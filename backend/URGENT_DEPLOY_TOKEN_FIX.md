# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Token Refresh Fix - Ready for Deployment

## Production Issue
Users are unable to refresh their authentication tokens, causing them to be logged out frequently.

## Root Cause
The refresh token flow was incorrectly sending a SECRET_HASH parameter when the Cognito app client doesn't have a secret configured (`generate_secret = false` in Terraform).

## Fix Applied
The fix has been implemented in `backend/src/refresh_token/cognito_client.py`:
- Removed SECRET_HASH calculation for REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH flow
- Added better error messages for debugging
- The code now correctly handles app clients without secrets

## Deploy Now
Execute these commands to deploy the fix:

```bash
cd C:\Claude\ai-lifestyle-app
git add backend/src/refresh_token/cognito_client.py
git commit -m "fix: remove SECRET_HASH from token refresh flow

- Remove SECRET_HASH calculation for REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH flow when app client has no secret
- Add better error messages for Invalid Refresh Token errors
- Fix production issue where users cannot refresh tokens

The Cognito app client is configured without a secret (generate_secret = false),
so we should not send SECRET_HASH in the refresh token flow."

git push origin main
```

## Verification
After deployment:
1. Test token refresh with existing refresh tokens
2. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any errors
3. Check metrics for successful token refreshes

## Impact
This fix will immediately resolve the token refresh issue for all users.
