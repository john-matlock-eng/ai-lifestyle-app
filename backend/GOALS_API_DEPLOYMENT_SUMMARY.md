# Goals API Deployment - Architecture Update

## Executive Summary

The goals API routes are now ready for deployment through the existing CI/CD pipeline. A critical architecture discovery was made during implementation.

## Key Discovery

The application uses a **single Lambda function pattern** where all routes are handled by one Lambda function (`api-handler`) with `main.py` acting as a router. The initial approach of creating a separate goals Lambda was incorrect and has been corrected.

## Changes Made

1. **Infrastructure** ✅
   - Added goals DynamoDB tables (goals, goal-aggregations)
   - Added S3 bucket for goal attachments
   - Added EventBridge rules for scheduled processing
   - Added SNS/SQS for notifications

2. **Lambda Configuration** ✅
   - Updated api_lambda with goals environment variables
   - Added IAM policies for goals resource access
   - No new Lambda needed - goals handlers already exist in src/

3. **API Gateway Routes** ✅
   - Added all 8 goals endpoints to routes configuration
   - Routes use existing Lambda integration
   - Authorization set to NONE temporarily

## Deployment Process

The GitHub Actions workflow will handle everything automatically:

```
PR Created → Deploy to Dev → Test → Merge → Deploy to Prod
```

No manual intervention required.

## Frontend Impact

Once deployed, all goals endpoints will be accessible:
- GET/POST /goals
- GET/PUT/DELETE /goals/{goalId}
- GET/POST /goals/{goalId}/activities
- GET /goals/{goalId}/progress

This unblocks the frontend team's goals feature development.

## Next Steps

1. Create PR with these changes
2. Review and approve
3. CI/CD deploys automatically
4. Frontend can start using goals API

**Status**: Ready for PR creation
