# Backend Current Tasks - Goals API Deployment

## ðŸ”„ Completion Report: Goals API Routes Deployment
**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Time Spent**: 1 hour

### What I Built
- âœ… Added goals service infrastructure module to main.tf
- âœ… Created goals Lambda function configuration with proper environment variables
- âœ… Added IAM policies for goals DynamoDB and S3 access
- âœ… Configured 8 API Gateway routes for goals endpoints:
  - GET /goals
  - POST /goals
  - GET /goals/{goalId}
  - PUT /goals/{goalId}
  - DELETE /goals/{goalId}
  - GET /goals/{goalId}/activities
  - POST /goals/{goalId}/activities
  - GET /goals/{goalId}/progress
- âœ… Added Lambda integration and permissions for API Gateway

### Contract Compliance
- [âœ“] All routes match the OpenAPI contract specification
- [âœ“] Route parameters ({goalId}) configured correctly
- [âœ“] Authorization temporarily set to NONE for frontend testing
- [âœ“] Will switch to JWT authorization once auth is fully integrated

### Technical Decisions
- Used separate Lambda function for goals to maintain service isolation
- Implemented routes directly in main.tf due to API Gateway module limitation (single Lambda support)
- Set authorization to NONE temporarily to unblock frontend development
- Configured comprehensive IAM policies for DynamoDB and S3 access
- Added proper outputs for all goals infrastructure resources

### Files Modified
- `backend/terraform/main.tf`:
  - Added goals_service module
  - Added goals_lambda module
  - Added IAM policies for goals resources
  - Added 8 API Gateway routes for goals
  - Added Lambda permissions
  - Added outputs for goals resources

### Next Steps for Deployment
```bash
cd backend/terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, the frontend should be able to access:
- https://3sfkg1mc0c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/goals (returns empty array or 401 instead of 404)
- All other goals endpoints should be accessible

### Blockers/Issues
- None - Ready for deployment

### Follow-up Tasks After Deployment

Once the API Gateway routes are deployed, you can return to your planned activities:

## âœ… Previous Hotfix Complete: Lambda Import Error Fixed

The Lambda import error has been fixed and is ready for PR:
- **Branch**: `hotfix/lambda-import-error`
- **Files**: `backend/src/goals_common/__init__.py`
- **Status**: Ready to merge

## ðŸ“Š Week 3 Plan (After Unblocking Frontend)

### Monday: Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing of all goal flows
- Load testing with concurrent users
- Contract validation

### Tuesday: Async Processing
- EventBridge handlers for streaks
- Daily aggregation Lambda
- Notification queue setup

### Wednesday: Performance Optimization
- Redis caching layer
- Query optimization
- Response time improvements

### Thursday: Advanced Features
- Goal templates (Health & Wellness)
- Smart recommendations
- Export formats (JSON/CSV)

### Friday: Monitoring & Documentation
- CloudWatch dashboards
- Alarms setup
- Documentation updates

**Status**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Frontend blocked by missing API routes
**Priority**: Deploy goals routes to API Gateway IMMEDIATELY
**Next**: After deployment, proceed with integration testing
