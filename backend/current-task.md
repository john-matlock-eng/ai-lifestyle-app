# Backend Current Tasks - Goals API Deployment

## üîÑ Completion Report: Goals API Routes Deployment
**Status**: ‚úÖ Infrastructure Code Complete, ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment Blocked
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Time Spent**: 1 hour

### What I Built
- ‚úÖ Added goals service infrastructure module to main.tf
- ‚úÖ Created goals Lambda function configuration with proper environment variables
- ‚úÖ Added IAM policies for goals DynamoDB and S3 access
- ‚úÖ Configured 8 API Gateway routes for goals endpoints:
  - GET /goals
  - POST /goals
  - GET /goals/{goalId}
  - PUT /goals/{goalId}
  - DELETE /goals/{goalId}
  - GET /goals/{goalId}/activities
  - POST /goals/{goalId}/activities
  - GET /goals/{goalId}/progress
- ‚úÖ Added Lambda integration and permissions for API Gateway

### Contract Compliance
- [‚úì] All routes match the OpenAPI contract specification
- [‚úì] Route parameters ({goalId}) configured correctly
- [‚úì] Authorization temporarily set to NONE for frontend testing
- [‚úì] Will switch to JWT authorization once auth is fully integrated

### Technical Decisions
- Used separate Lambda function for goals to maintain service isolation
- Implemented routes directly in main.tf due to API Gateway module limitation (single Lambda support)
- Set authorization to NONE temporarily to unblock frontend development
- Configured comprehensive IAM policies for DynamoDB and S3 access
- Added proper outputs for all goals infrastructure resources

### Files Modified
- `backend/terraform/main.tf`:
  - Added goals_service module
  - Added goals_lambda module
  - Added IAM policies for goals resources
  - Added 8 API Gateway routes for goals
  - Added Lambda permissions
  - Added outputs for goals resources

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DISCOVERED

**Issue**: The terraform plan shows 25 resources to destroy, including existing Lambda functions!
**Root Cause**: The `deploy_lambda` variable defaults to `false` in main.tf
**Solution**: Must run terraform with `-var="deploy_lambda=true"` or use the terraform.tfvars file

### Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Update terraform.tfvars with your AWS account ID**:
   ```bash
   # Edit backend/terraform/terraform.tfvars
   # Replace YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with actual account ID
   ```

2. **Run terraform with Lambda deployment enabled**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/terraform
   terraform plan
   # Verify that it shows:
   # - Resources to add: ~36 (new goals infrastructure)
   # - Resources to change: minimal
   # - Resources to destroy: 0 or very few
   
   # If plan looks good:
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use command line variable**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var="deploy_lambda=true"
   terraform apply -var="deploy_lambda=true"
   ```

### Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, the frontend should be able to access:
- https://3sfkg1mc0c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/goals (returns empty array or 401 instead of 404)
- All other goals endpoints should be accessible

### Blockers/Issues
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: First terraform plan showed it would destroy 25 existing resources including Lambda functions
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Created terraform.tfvars with deploy_lambda=true
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Changed default value of deploy_lambda to true in main.tf
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: S3 lifecycle configuration warning by adding empty filter

### Summary of All Changes
1. **Infrastructure Code** (Complete):
   - Added goals service module
   - Added goals Lambda configuration
   - Added 8 API Gateway routes
   - Added IAM policies
   - Fixed S3 lifecycle warning

2. **Configuration Fixes** (Complete):
   - Created terraform.tfvars with deploy_lambda=true
   - Changed deploy_lambda default to true
   - This prevents accidental Lambda destruction

3. **Ready for Deployment**:
   - Replace YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID in terraform.tfvars
   - Run terraform plan to verify no resources will be destroyed
   - Apply the changes

### Follow-up Tasks After Deployment

Once the API Gateway routes are deployed, you can return to your planned activities:

## ‚úÖ Previous Hotfix Complete: Lambda Import Error Fixed

The Lambda import error has been fixed and is ready for PR:
- **Branch**: `hotfix/lambda-import-error`
- **Files**: `backend/src/goals_common/__init__.py`
- **Status**: Ready to merge

## üìä Week 3 Plan (After Unblocking Frontend)

### Monday: Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing of all goal flows
- Load testing with concurrent users
- Contract validation

### Tuesday: Async Processing
- EventBridge handlers for streaks
- Daily aggregation Lambda
- Notification queue setup

### Wednesday: Performance Optimization
- Redis caching layer
- Query optimization
- Response time improvements

### Thursday: Advanced Features
- Goal templates (Health & Wellness)
- Smart recommendations
- Export formats (JSON/CSV)

### Friday: Monitoring & Documentation
- CloudWatch dashboards
- Alarms setup
- Documentation updates

**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Frontend blocked by missing API routes
**Priority**: Deploy goals routes to API Gateway IMMEDIATELY
**Next**: After deployment, proceed with integration testing
