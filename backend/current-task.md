## 🎯 Current Tasks: Support & Monitor

### Task 1: Monitor API Health (ONGOING)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Description**: Watch CloudWatch logs for any errors during frontend integration

**What to monitor**:
- Lambda function errors
- DynamoDB throttling
- API Gateway 4xx/5xx responses
- S3 access issues

**Key Metrics**:
```bash
# CloudWatch Logs Insights query for errors
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| stats count() by bin(5m)
```

### Task 2: Support Frontend Team (AS NEEDED)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Description**: Be available to help debug any integration issues

**Common issues to watch for**:
1. **Auth errors**: Ensure JWT token is properly formatted
2. **Validation errors**: Check request payload matches contract
3. **Not found errors**: Verify goalId exists and belongs to user
4. **Permission errors**: Check IAM policies if DynamoDB errors

### Task 3: Performance Optimization (LATER THIS WEEK)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Description**: After integration testing, optimize slow queries

**Areas to investigate**:
- Goal listing with multiple filters
- Activity pagination for goals with many entries
- Progress calculation for long-term goals

### Task 4: Prepare for Load Testing (FRIDAY)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Set up load testing scenarios

**Test scenarios**:
1. Create 100 goals per user
2. Log 1000 activities across goals
3. Concurrent goal updates
4. Heavy list queries with filters

## 📊 Quick Reference for Frontend

### Authentication
```bash
# Frontend should send:
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token_from_cognito>
```

### Example Requests

**Create Goal**:
```json
POST /v1/goals
{
  "title": "Walk 10,000 steps daily",
  "category": "fitness",
  "goalPattern": "recurring",
  "target": {
    "metric": "count",
    "value": 10000,
    "unit": "steps",
    "period": "day",
    "direction": "increase"
  }
}
```

**Log Activity**:
```json
POST /v1/goals/{goalId}/activities
{
  "value": 12500,
  "unit": "steps",
  "activityType": "completed",
  "context": {
    "energyLevel": 8,
    "mood": "energetic"
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If Frontend Gets 403 Forbidden
1. Check JWT token is included
2. Verify token hasn't expired
3. Ensure goalId belongs to authenticated user

### If Frontend Gets 400 Bad Request
1. Check field names are camelCase (not snake_case)
2. Verify required fields are present
3. Check data types match contract

### If Frontend Gets 500 Internal Error
1. Check CloudWatch logs immediately
2. Look for DynamoDB or S3 errors
3. Notify PM if infrastructure issue
