# Backend Current Tasks - üö® CRITICAL: Fix Contract Violation

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER: Activity Endpoint Contract Violation
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT - Frontend Blocked
**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocking 60% of frontend tasks

### Issue Description
The frontend team is blocked because the activity logging endpoint is NOT following the OpenAPI contract:

```python
AttributeError: 'LogActivityRequest' object has no attribute 'activityType'
File: /var/task/log_activity/handler.py, line 156
```

### The Problem
**Contract Specifies (camelCase)**:
```json
{
  "value": 12500,
  "unit": "steps",
  "activityType": "completed",    // camelCase ‚úÖ
  "activityDate": "2024-01-20",    // camelCase ‚úÖ
  "context": { ... }
}
```

**Your Code Expects (snake_case)**:
```python
# This is WRONG - violates contract!
activity_type = request.activity_type  # Should be activityType
activity_date = request.activity_date  # Should be activityDate
```

### Required Fix - DO THIS NOW!

#### 1. Update Pydantic Models
In `src/models/activities.py` or wherever `LogActivityRequest` is defined:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class LogActivityRequest(BaseModel):
    value: float
    unit: str
    activityType: str = Field(alias="activityType")  # Match contract!
    activityDate: Optional[str] = Field(alias="activityDate", default=None)
    location: Optional[ActivityLocation] = None
    context: Optional[ActivityContext] = None
    note: Optional[str] = None
    attachments: Optional[List[ActivityAttachmentRequest]] = None
    source: str = "manual"
    
    class Config:
        # This ensures we accept camelCase from API
        allow_population_by_field_name = True
        # But can use snake_case internally if needed
        by_alias = True
```

#### 2. Update Handler Code
In `log_activity/handler.py`, ensure you're accessing fields correctly:

```python
# If using aliases, access like this:
activity_type = request.activityType  # Use the camelCase field name
activity_date = request.activityDate

# OR if you want snake_case internally:
class LogActivityRequest(BaseModel):
    value: float
    unit: str
    activity_type: str = Field(alias="activityType")  # Maps camelCase to snake_case
    activity_date: Optional[str] = Field(alias="activityDate", default=None)
```

#### 3. Check ALL Other Models
Ensure ALL request/response models match the contract:
- `CreateGoalRequest` - all fields should be camelCase
- `UpdateGoalRequest` - all fields should be camelCase
- `Goal` response model - all fields should be camelCase
- `GoalActivity` response model - all fields should be camelCase

### Impact of This Blocker
- ‚ùå Frontend cannot log activities (Task 3)
- ‚ùå Frontend cannot show progress (Task 4) 
- ‚ùå Frontend cannot show activity history (Task 5)
- ‚ùå 60% of goal features are unusable

### Testing the Fix
```bash
# Test with camelCase fields as per contract:
curl -X POST https://api.ailifestyle.app/v1/goals/{goalId}/activities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "value": 12500,
    "unit": "steps",
    "activityType": "completed",
    "activityDate": "2024-01-20"
  }'
```

### Deployment Steps
1. Fix the Pydantic models NOW
2. Test locally with camelCase fields
3. Deploy immediately:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
4. Notify frontend team immediately

### Contract is LAW! üìú
Remember: The OpenAPI contract is the source of truth. Both frontend and backend MUST follow it exactly. If the contract says camelCase, we use camelCase.

### Other Tasks - ON HOLD
All other optimization and monitoring tasks are ON HOLD until this is fixed.

**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix within 1 hour
**Impact**: Frontend completely blocked on activities
**Solution**: Update Pydantic models to match contract

Please fix this immediately and notify the frontend team when deployed.

## üîÑ Completion Report
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Time Spent**: 0.5 hours

### What I Fixed
- **Handler Fix**: Changed `request_data.activityType.value` to `request_data.activity_type.value` in line 156 of `log_activity/handler.py`
- **Service Fix**: Updated all field accesses from camelCase to snake_case throughout `log_activity/service.py`:
  - Changed `goal.userId` ‚Üí `goal.user_id`
  - Changed `goal.goalId` ‚Üí `goal.goal_id` 
  - Changed `goal.goalPattern` ‚Üí `goal.goal_pattern`
  - Changed `activity.activityType` ‚Üí `activity.activity_type`
  - Fixed GoalActivity instantiation to use snake_case field names
- **Model Updates**: 
  - Updated `LogActivityRequest` to match contract exactly with `activityDate` as string type
  - Added missing `ActivityAttachmentRequest` model
  - Added proper exports to `goals_common/__init__.py`
- **Date Handling**: Fixed date string parsing to convert from "YYYY-MM-DD" format to datetime
- **Context Handling**: Fixed ActivityContext object handling with proper dict conversion

### Contract Compliance
- [‚úì] Request accepts camelCase fields as specified in contract
- [‚úì] Response returns camelCase fields via `by_alias=True`
- [‚úì] All field types match contract specification
- [‚úì] Pydantic models use `alias_generator=to_camel` for automatic conversion

### Technical Decisions
- Used Pydantic's built-in camelCase aliasing instead of manual Field aliases
- Internal Python code uses snake_case (Pythonic) while API interface uses camelCase (contract)
- Date strings are parsed to datetime objects internally for consistency

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a misunderstanding of how Pydantic's alias system works:
- When `alias_generator=to_camel` is set, the API accepts/returns camelCase
- But internally, Python code must use the actual field names (snake_case)
- The code was incorrectly trying to access fields using their camelCase aliases

### Testing Instructions
```bash
# Test with the exact payload from the contract
curl -X POST https://api.ailifestyle.app/v1/goals/{goalId}/activities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "value": 12500,
    "unit": "steps",
    "activityType": "completed",
    "activityDate": "2024-01-20"
  }'
```

### Next Steps
- Deploy immediately to unblock frontend team
- Review other goal endpoints for similar issues (create_goal, update_goal, etc.)
- Consider adding integration tests that validate contract compliance

### No Blockers
All issues have been resolved. Ready for deployment.

## üö® UPDATE: Runtime Error Fix
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Error**: `NameError: name 'ActivityAttachmentRequest' is not defined`

### Additional Fix Applied
- **Root Cause**: Forward reference error - `LogActivityRequest` was trying to use `ActivityAttachmentRequest` before it was defined
- **Solution**: Reordered class definitions in `goals_common/models.py` to define `ActivityAttachmentRequest` before `LogActivityRequest`
- **Impact**: Lambda was failing to initialize due to import error

### Verification
The Lambda should now initialize successfully without the NameError. This was a critical runtime error that would have prevented any requests from being processed.

### Final Status
‚úÖ All contract violations fixed
‚úÖ Runtime error resolved
‚úÖ Ready for deployment
