# Backend Current Tasks - Goals API Deployment

## ðŸ”„ Completion Report: Goals API Routes Deployment
**Status**: âœ… Infrastructure Code Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

### What I Built
- âœ… Added goals service infrastructure module to main.tf
- âœ… Added goals DynamoDB and S3 IAM policies
- âœ… Configured 8 API Gateway routes for goals endpoints in the main routes configuration
- âœ… Updated api_lambda with goals environment variables
- âœ… Updated api_lambda with goals IAM policies

### Critical Architecture Discovery
**Issue**: Initial approach created a separate goals Lambda function, but the CI/CD pipeline uses a **single Lambda pattern** where `main.py` routes all requests.

**Solution**: 
- Removed separate goals_lambda module
- Added goals routes to the main API Gateway routes configuration
- Added goals environment variables to api_lambda
- Added goals IAM policies to api_lambda
- All goals handlers are already present in src/ and included in the Docker build

### Contract Compliance
- [âœ“] All routes match the OpenAPI contract specification
- [âœ“] Route parameters ({goalId}) configured correctly
- [âœ“] Authorization temporarily set to NONE for frontend testing
- [âœ“] Will switch to JWT authorization once auth is fully integrated

### Technical Decisions
- Use existing single Lambda pattern (api-handler) for all routes
- Goals handlers already exist in src/ directory and are included in Docker build
- main.py already has all goals route mappings configured
- Fixed S3 lifecycle configuration warning by adding empty filter
- Goals infrastructure (DynamoDB tables, S3 bucket) deployed in Phase 1
- Goals routes available after Phase 3 (Lambda deployment)

### Files Modified
- `backend/terraform/main.tf`:
  - Added goals_service module for infrastructure
  - Added goals environment variables to api_lambda
  - Added goals IAM policies to api_lambda
  - Added 8 goals routes to API Gateway routes configuration
  - Removed separate goals_lambda module (not needed)
- `backend/terraform/services/goals/main.tf`:
  - Fixed S3 lifecycle configuration warning

### How Deployment Works

The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (`backend-deploy.yml`) deploys in 3 phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure (deploy_lambda=false)
   - Creates ECR, Cognito, DynamoDB tables
   - Creates goals tables and S3 bucket

2. **Phase 2**: Docker Build
   - Builds api-handler image containing all handlers
   - Pushes to ECR

3. **Phase 3**: Lambda Deployment (deploy_lambda=true)
   - Deploys Lambda with all routes including goals
   - API Gateway routes become active

### Next Steps
1. **Create PR** with these changes
2. **CI/CD will automatically**:
   - Deploy to dev environment on PR
   - Deploy to prod on merge to main
3. **Verify** goals endpoints are accessible after deployment

### Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, the frontend should be able to access:
- `https://3sfkg1mc0c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/goals`
- All other goals endpoints

### Summary
- Infrastructure code is ready for CI/CD deployment
- Goals functionality integrated into existing single Lambda architecture
- No manual terraform commands needed - GitHub Actions handles everything
- Frontend will be unblocked once PR is merged and deployed
