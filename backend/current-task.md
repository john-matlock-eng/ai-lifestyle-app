# Backend Current Tasks - üö® CRITICAL: Production Down!

## üî¥ URGENT: Authentication Lambda is Failing!

### Production is DOWN - All logins are failing!

**Error**: 
```
Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'main': 
cannot import name 'GoalValidationError' from 'goals_common'
```

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Check** `goals_common/__init__.py` - is `GoalValidationError` exported?
2. **Check** `goals_common/errors.py` - does this class exist?
3. **Find** where it's being imported - likely in auth handler

### Quick Fix Options:

#### Option A: Add the export
```python
# goals_common/__init__.py
from .errors import GoalValidationError  # ADD THIS
```

#### Option B: Fix the import
```python
# In the file that's failing:
# Change: from goals_common import GoalValidationError
# To: from goals_common.errors import GoalValidationError
```

### Most Likely Fix Location:

1. **Check if GoalValidationError exists**:
   ```bash
   # Look in goals_common/errors.py
   cat backend/goals_common/errors.py | grep GoalValidationError
   ```

2. **Check the __init__.py file**:
   ```bash
   # See what's currently exported
   cat backend/goals_common/__init__.py
   ```

3. **Find where it's imported**:
   ```bash
   # This will show you which file has the bad import
   grep -r "from goals_common import" backend/handlers/
   ```

### Most Likely Solution:
The auth handler is probably trying to import `GoalValidationError` but it's not exported in `goals_common/__init__.py`. 

Either:
- Add `from .errors import GoalValidationError` to goals_common/__init__.py
- Or change the import in the auth handler to: `from goals_common.errors import GoalValidationError`

## ‚è∞ Timeline
- **16:22 UTC**: First error detected
- **16:23 UTC**: Multiple failures, all auth requests failing
- **NOW**: Fix and deploy immediately!

## üìä Impact
- ‚ùå No users can login
- ‚ùå No new registrations
- ‚ùå API effectively offline
- ‚ùå Frontend team blocked
