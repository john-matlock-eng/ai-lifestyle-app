# Backend Current Tasks - ðŸŽ‰ Hotfix Applied!

## âœ… HOTFIX COMPLETE: Lambda Import Error Fixed

### What Was Fixed
**File**: `backend/src/goals_common/__init__.py`
**Issue**: Missing error class exports causing Lambda import failures
**Solution**: Added all error classes to imports and `__all__` list

### Changes Made
```python
# Added imports:
from .errors import (
    GoalError,
    GoalNotFoundError,
    GoalValidationError,  # This was the missing one!
    GoalQuotaExceededError,
    GoalPermissionError,
    ActivityNotFoundError,
    ActivityValidationError,
    InvalidGoalPatternError,
    GoalAlreadyCompletedError,
    InvalidDateRangeError,
    GoalArchivedException,
    AttachmentUploadError,
    GoalSyncError,
)

# Also added to __all__ list for proper exports
```

### Testing
Created `test_goals_common_imports.py` to verify the fix:
```bash
cd backend
python test_goals_common_imports.py
```

### PR Instructions
1. **Branch name**: `hotfix/lambda-import-error`
2. **Commit message**: 
   ```
   fix: Add missing error exports to goals_common module
   
   - Added all error classes to __init__.py exports
   - Fixes Lambda import error for GoalValidationError
   - Prevents authentication service failures
   
   Fixes production outage reported at 16:22 UTC
   ```
3. **Files changed**: 
   - `backend/src/goals_common/__init__.py`
   - `backend/test_goals_common_imports.py` (optional - for verification)

### Terraform Deployment
After PR merge:
```bash
terraform apply -target=module.lambda_auth
```

## ðŸ“Š Back to Regular Programming: Testing & Optimization Phase

### Monday: Integration Testing
**Priority**: Ensure rock-solid reliability before frontend integration

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   ```python
   # Test scenarios to cover:
   - Complete user journey (create â†’ log â†’ track â†’ complete)
   - All 5 goal patterns with real data
   - Edge cases (max goals, concurrent updates)
   - Error scenarios (invalid data, auth failures)
   ```

2. **Load Testing**
   ```python
   # Performance targets:
   - 100 concurrent users creating goals
   - 1000 activity logs per minute
   - Progress calculation under 100ms
   - List operations under 200ms
   ```

3. **Contract Validation**
   - Run full contract test suite
   - Verify all response shapes
   - Test error response formats

### Tuesday: Async Processing Implementation

1. **EventBridge Handlers**
   ```python
   # streak_calculator/handler.py
   - Listen for activity logged events
   - Calculate streak status
   - Update goal if streak broken/extended
   - Emit streak milestone events
   ```

2. **Daily Aggregation Lambda**
   ```python
   # daily_aggregator/handler.py
   - Run at midnight UTC
   - Calculate daily statistics
   - Update progress snapshots
   - Generate insight recommendations
   ```

3. **Notification Queue**
   - Goal milestone achieved
   - Streak at risk warnings
   - Weekly progress summaries

### Wednesday: Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Layer** (Redis approved! ðŸŽ‰)
   ```python
   # Add Redis/ElastiCache for:
   - User's active goals list (5 min TTL)
   - Current progress calculations (1 hour TTL)
   - Frequently accessed goal details
   - Activity aggregations
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Review DynamoDB access patterns
   - Add missing GSI indexes
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Connection pooling

3. **Response Time Improvements**
   - Profile slow operations
   - Optimize progress calculations
   - Implement pagination cursors
   - Reduce payload sizes

### Thursday: Advanced Features

1. **Goal Templates** (Start with Health & Wellness)
   ```python
   # Priority order:
   1. "Drink 8 glasses of water daily"
   2. "Exercise 30 minutes 3x/week"
   3. "Meditate 10 minutes daily"
   4. "Sleep 8 hours nightly"
   5. "Walk 10,000 steps daily"
   ```

2. **Smart Recommendations**
   ```python
   # Based on:
   - User's existing goals
   - Success patterns
   - Similar users
   - Time of year
   ```

3. **Export Formats** (Both JSON and CSV approved!)
   - JSON: Full fidelity with all context
   - CSV: Simplified for spreadsheets
   - Future: PDF reports

### Friday: Monitoring & Documentation

1. **CloudWatch Dashboards**
   - API response times
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Goal pattern distribution
   - Activity logging patterns

2. **Alarms Setup**
   - High error rates
   - Slow response times
   - DynamoDB throttling
   - Lambda errors

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - API usage examples
   - Best practices guide
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Performance tips

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of Done for Week 3

### Testing Complete
