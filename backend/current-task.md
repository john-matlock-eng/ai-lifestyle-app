## 🔄 Week 3 Focus: Testing & Enhancement

### Monday: Integration Testing
**Priority**: Ensure rock-solid reliability before frontend integration

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   ```python
   # Test scenarios to cover:
   - Complete user journey (create → log → track → complete)
   - All 5 goal patterns with real data
   - Edge cases (max goals, concurrent updates)
   - Error scenarios (invalid data, auth failures)
   ```

2. **Load Testing**
   ```python
   # Performance targets:
   - 100 concurrent users creating goals
   - 1000 activity logs per minute
   - Progress calculation under 100ms
   - List operations under 200ms
   ```

3. **Contract Validation**
   - Run full contract test suite
   - Verify all response shapes
   - Test error response formats

### Tuesday: Async Processing Implementation

1. **EventBridge Handlers**
   ```python
   # streak_calculator/handler.py
   - Listen for activity logged events
   - Calculate streak status
   - Update goal if streak broken/extended
   - Emit streak milestone events
   ```

2. **Daily Aggregation Lambda**
   ```python
   # daily_aggregator/handler.py
   - Run at midnight UTC
   - Calculate daily statistics
   - Update progress snapshots
   - Generate insight recommendations
   ```

3. **Notification Queue**
   - Goal milestone achieved
   - Streak at risk warnings
   - Weekly progress summaries

### Wednesday: Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Layer**
   ```python
   # Add Redis/ElastiCache for:
   - User's active goals list
   - Current progress calculations
   - Frequently accessed goal details
   - Activity aggregations
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Review DynamoDB access patterns
   - Add missing GSI indexes
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Connection pooling

3. **Response Time Improvements**
   - Profile slow operations
   - Optimize progress calculations
   - Implement pagination cursors
   - Reduce payload sizes

### Thursday: Advanced Features

1. **Goal Templates**
   ```python
   # Popular preset goals:
   - "Drink 8 glasses of water daily"
   - "Exercise 30 minutes 3x/week"
   - "Read 20 pages daily"
   - "Meditate 10 minutes daily"
   ```

2. **Smart Recommendations**
   ```python
   # Based on:
   - User's existing goals
   - Success patterns
   - Similar users
   - Time of year
   ```

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Archive multiple goals
   - Bulk activity logging
   - Export goal data

### Friday: Monitoring & Documentation

1. **CloudWatch Dashboards**
   - API response times
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Goal pattern distribution
   - Activity logging patterns

2. **Alarms Setup**
   - High error rates
   - Slow response times
   - DynamoDB throttling
   - Lambda errors

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - API usage examples
   - Best practices guide
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Performance tips

## 🎯 Definition of Done for Week 3

### Testing Complete
- [ ] All endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] Load testing shows good performance
- [ ] Contract tests pass 100%
- [ ] Error scenarios covered

### Async Processing Live
- [ ] Streak calculation working
- [ ] Daily aggregation running
- [ ] Notifications configured
- [ ] Event flow documented

### Performance Optimized
- [ ] Response times < 200ms p99
- [ ] Caching layer operational
- [ ] Queries optimized
- [ ] Monitoring in place

## 💡 Architecture Decisions Needed

### 1. Caching Strategy
**Options**:
- Redis for all caching (recommended)
- DynamoDB with TTL
- Lambda memory caching
- ElastiCache managed service

**Recommendation**: Redis with 5-minute TTL for goals, 1-hour for progress

### 2. Streak Calculation
**Options**:
- Real-time on every activity
- Batch every hour
- Daily calculation
- On-demand with caching

**Recommendation**: Real-time with async update + daily verification

### 3. Progress Snapshots
**Options**:
- Store daily snapshots
- Calculate on demand
- Hybrid approach
- Time-series database

**Recommendation**: Daily snapshots for trending, real-time for current

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

### After Testing Phase
1. **Journal Integration** - Goals will enhance journaling
2. **AI Analysis** - Rich activity context enables insights
3. **Social Features** - Share goals, compete with friends
4. **Gamification** - Achievements, badges, rewards

### Your Impact
Your implementation provides the foundation for:
- Behavior change tracking
- Habit formation support
- Personal growth insights
- Data-driven coaching

## 📝 Questions for PM

1. **Caching Budget**: Can we add Redis for performance?
2. **Notification Preferences**: Email, push, or both?
3. **Template Priorities**: Which goal templates first?
4. **Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, or both?
