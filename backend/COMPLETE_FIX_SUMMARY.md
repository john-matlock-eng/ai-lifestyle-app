# Complete Fix Summary - Login Endpoint & Security

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DynamoDB Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: Login was failing with "Query condition missed key schema element: gsi1_pk"
**Solution**: Updated login repository to use correct DynamoDB key patterns
- Email queries: `gsi1_pk = EMAIL#{email}`
- User ID queries: `pk = USER#{user_id}`, `sk = USER#{user_id}`
- Added field mapping (snake_case â†’ camelCase)

### 2. Password Logging Security Issue
**Problem**: Passwords were being logged in request bodies
**Solution**: 
- Sanitized event logging in main.py
- Added `repr=False` to password fields
- Created security audit script
