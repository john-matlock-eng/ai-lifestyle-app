# Example Terraform variables for local development
# DO NOT use this file for CI/CD deployments - GitHub Actions handles variables automatically

# For local testing only:
environment = "dev"
aws_account_id = "YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID"  # Replace with actual account ID
deploy_lambda = true  # Set to true after infrastructure is created
api_handler_image_tag = "latest"  # Or specific tag like "api-handler-dev-latest"
