# 🔧 FIXED: Email Verification Not Sending

## Root Cause Found! 

The Terraform configuration had this setting:
```hcl
auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]
```

This tells Cognito to **automatically mark emails as verified WITHOUT sending verification emails**. This is the opposite of what we want!

## ✅ Fix Applied

1. **Removed** `auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]` from Terraform
2. Cognito will now:
   - Send verification emails on registration
   - Keep email_verified = false until user verifies
   - Use the configured email templates

## 🚀 Deployment Required

**IMPORTANT**: This is an infrastructure change that requires Terraform deployment:

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove auto_verified_attributes to enable email verification"
git push

# 2. The GitHub Actions workflow will apply Terraform changes
# This will update the Cognito User Pool configuration
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Existing User Pool**: This change will modify the existing Cognito User Pool
2. **No Data Loss**: Existing users won't be affected
3. **New Users Only**: Only new registrations will receive verification emails
4. **Email Limits**: Cognito default service = 50 emails/day (sandbox)

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. Register a new user
2. Check email for verification code
3. Should receive email with:
   - Subject: "Verify your email for AI Lifestyle App"
   - Body: "Your verification code for AI Lifestyle App is 123456"

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify in AWS Console:
- [ ] Cognito User Pool → General Settings → Attributes
- [ ] "email" should NOT be in auto-verified attributes
- [ ] Message customizations show correct templates
- [ ] Email configuration = COGNITO_DEFAULT

## 🔍 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Spam Folder**: Cognito emails often go to spam
2. **Email Limits**: You might have hit the 50/day limit
3. **AWS Region**: Ensure Cognito is in a region that supports email
4. **CloudWatch Logs**: Check for any email sending errors

## 📈 Future Improvements

For production:
1. Set up AWS SES for better deliverability
2. Verify domain for custom "from" address
3. Increase email limits
4. Custom email templates with branding
