# üö® Email Verification Issue - FIXED!

## The Problem
Users were not receiving verification emails after registration.

## Root Cause
The Terraform configuration had this setting:
```hcl
auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]
```

This tells Cognito to **skip email verification entirely** and automatically mark all emails as verified. This prevented any verification emails from being sent!

## The Fix
1. ‚úÖ **Removed** `auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]` from `terraform/modules/cognito/main.tf`
2. ‚úÖ **Updated** registration code to use `sign_up` flow (already done)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deploy** the Terraform changes (required!)

## Deploy the Fix
```bash
# Push the changes to trigger deployment
git add terraform/modules/cognito/main.tf
git commit -m "fix: remove auto_verified_attributes to enable email verification"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. Run Terraform apply
2. Update the Cognito User Pool configuration
3. Enable email verification for new registrations

## After Deployment
New user registrations will:
- Receive verification email immediately
- Email subject: "Verify your email for AI Lifestyle App"
- Email body: "Your verification code for AI Lifestyle App is 123456"
- Users verify with our `/auth/email/verify` endpoint

## Testing
Use the debug script to verify configuration:
```powershell
.\scripts\debug-cognito-email.ps1
```

This will show if `auto_verified_attributes` is properly removed.
