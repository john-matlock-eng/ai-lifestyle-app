# Current Deployment Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working
- ECR repository `lifestyle-app-dev` has been created
- DynamoDB table `users-dev` has been created
- IAM policies have been created

## ❌ What Failed
- Lambda function creation failed because Docker images don't exist yet
- Cognito might have failed due to IAM permissions

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Images

```bash
# From the backend directory
cd /path/to/backend

# Get ECR login token
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Build the API handler image
docker build -f Dockerfile.api-handler -t api-handler:latest .

# Tag it for your ECR repository
docker tag api-handler:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lifestyle-app-dev:api-handler-dev-latest

# Push to ECR
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lifestyle-app-dev:api-handler-dev-latest

# Also build and push health check if needed
docker build -f Dockerfile.health-check -t health-check:latest .
docker tag health-check:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lifestyle-app-dev:health-check-dev-latest
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lifestyle-app-dev:health-check-dev-latest
```

### Step 2: Verify Images Were Pushed

```bash
# Check that images exist in ECR
aws ecr list-images --repository-name lifestyle-app-dev --region us-east-1
```

### Step 3: Deploy Lambda Functions

```bash
# Now deploy with Lambda enabled
cd terraform
terraform apply \
  -var="deploy_lambda=true" \
  -var="environment=dev" \
  -var="aws_account_id=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Use the Deployment Script

```bash
# The script handles all of this automatically
cd backend/scripts
./deploy-phased.sh dev
```

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Don't skip the Docker build step** - Lambda needs the images to exist
2. **Check your AWS_ACCOUNT_ID** - Make sure it's set correctly in commands
3. **Cognito permissions** - If Cognito creation failed, you'll need the IAM permissions added first

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing these steps, you should have:
- ✅ ECR repository with Docker images
- ✅ Cognito User Pool (if IAM permissions are fixed)
- ✅ DynamoDB tables
- ✅ Lambda function running your code
- ✅ All infrastructure ready for API Gateway

## Need Help?

Run the status check script to see what's missing:
```bash
cd backend/scripts
chmod +x check-deployment-status.sh
./check-deployment-status.sh dev
```
