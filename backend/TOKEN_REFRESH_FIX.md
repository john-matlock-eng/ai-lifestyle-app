# Token Refresh Fix Summary

## Issue
- **Error**: "Invalid Refresh Token" in production
- **Impact**: Users cannot refresh their authentication tokens

## Root Cause
The Cognito app client is configured without a secret (`generate_secret = false`), but the code was trying to send a SECRET_HASH parameter during token refresh.

## Fix Applied
Updated `backend/src/refresh_token/cognito_client.py`:
- Removed SECRET_HASH calculation for refresh token flow
- Improved error messages for debugging
- Enhanced logging

## Deploy Using GitHub Actions

1. **Commit the fix**:
```bash
git add backend/src/refresh_token/cognito_client.py
git commit -m "fix: remove SECRET_HASH from token refresh flow

- Cognito app client has no secret, so SECRET_HASH should not be sent
- Fixes 'Invalid Refresh Token' error in production
- Improves error messages for better debugging"
```

2. **Push to a feature branch**:
```bash
git push origin feature/fix-token-refresh
```

3. **Create PR to trigger deployment**:
- Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
- The `backend-deploy.yml` workflow will automatically deploy to `dev`
- After merge to main, it will deploy to `prod`

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/refresh_token/cognito_client.py` - Fixed the SECRET_HASH issue

## Verification
After deployment, monitor CloudWatch logs to ensure the error stops occurring.
