# ðŸ”„ Email Verification - Complete Fix Summary

## Status: âœ… ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED

### The Problem
- Users not receiving verification emails after registration
- Emails were being suppressed by Cognito configuration

### Root Cause
```hcl
# This was in terraform/modules/cognito/main.tf:
auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]
```
This setting tells Cognito to **automatically mark emails as verified** without sending any verification email!

### What I Fixed

1. **Code Changes** âœ…
   - Updated `register_user/cognito_client.py` to use `sign_up` flow
   - Removed `MessageAction='SUPPRESS'` 
   - Removed manual email sending code

2. **Infrastructure Fix** âœ…
   - Removed `auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]` from Terraform
   - Added output to track email verification status
   - Email templates already configured correctly

3. **Tests & Scripts** âœ…
   - Created `debug-cognito-email.ps1` to check configuration
   - Created `test-registration-email.ps1` for end-to-end testing
   - Updated unit tests

## ðŸš¨ ACTION REQUIRED

**Deploy the Terraform changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove auto_verified_attributes to enable email verification"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. Apply Terraform changes
2. Update Cognito User Pool configuration
3. Enable email verification

## After Deployment

New registrations will:
- âœ… Receive verification email immediately
- âœ… Email from: no-reply@verificationemail.com
- âœ… Subject: "Verify your email for AI Lifestyle App"
- âœ… Body: "Your verification code for AI Lifestyle App is 123456"

## Testing

1. **Check Configuration**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\debug-cognito-email.ps1
   ```
   Should show: "None" for auto-verified attributes

2. **Test Registration**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\test-registration-email.ps1
   ```
   Follow prompts to register and verify

## Important Notes

- **Spam Folder**: Check spam/junk - Cognito emails often go there
- **Limits**: 50 emails/day in sandbox mode
- **Existing Users**: Won't affect already registered users
- **7-Day Grace**: Users can still login without verification

## Files Changed

1. `terraform/modules/cognito/main.tf` - Removed auto_verified_attributes
2. `terraform/modules/cognito/outputs.tf` - Added verification status output
3. `src/register_user/cognito_client.py` - Use sign_up flow
4. `src/register_user/service.py` - Removed manual email sending
5. Various test files updated

## Summary

The email verification system is now properly configured. Once the Terraform changes are deployed, new users will receive verification emails automatically upon registration.
