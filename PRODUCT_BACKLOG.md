3. **Journal as Proving Ground**: First integrated module
4. **AI as Enhancement**: Not required for core functionality
5. **Privacy by Default**: Encryption on by default for all

This backlog ensures we build a solid foundation that makes every subsequent feature easier to implement while maintaining our privacy-first principles!
