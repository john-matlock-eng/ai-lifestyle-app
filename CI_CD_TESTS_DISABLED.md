# CI/CD Tests Disabled

## What was changed

### Frontend CI/CD
- **File**: `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`
- **Changes**: 
  - Commented out the entire `test` job
  - Removed `needs: test` dependency from both `deploy-dev` and `deploy-prod` jobs
  - Added comments indicating tests are temporarily disabled

### Backend CI/CD
- No backend tests were found in the workflows, so no changes were needed

## Impact
- Pull requests and pushes to main will now deploy directly without running:
  - Linting (`npm run lint`)
  - Type checking (`npm run type-check`)
  - Unit tests (`npm run test:ci`)
  - Build verification

## To Re-enable Tests
1. Uncomment the entire `test` job in `frontend-ci-cd.yml`
2. Add back `needs: test` to the `deploy-dev` and `deploy-prod` jobs
3. Remove the "TESTS DISABLED" comments

## Why Tests Were Disabled
Tests were temporarily disabled to allow faster deployment while addressing test failures related to:
- React 19 compatibility issues
- New component implementations
- Type checking errors

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Fix the failing tests locally
2. Update test configurations for React 19
3. Re-enable tests in CI/CD once they pass locally
4. Consider adding a separate "build-only" check as a minimal safety net

## Running Tests Locally
You can still run tests locally with:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test
```

**Note**: This is a temporary measure. Tests should be re-enabled as soon as possible to maintain code quality and prevent regressions.
