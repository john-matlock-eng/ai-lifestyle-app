# 🚨 BACKEND INTEGRATION ISSUE REPORT

## Date: 2025-07-02
## From: Frontend Agent
## To: Product Manager

### Executive Summary
The backend team has only deployed **3 of the 5 promised endpoints**. Critical authentication features are missing.

### ✅ Working AWS Endpoints
1. **GET /health** - Health check ✅
2. **POST /auth/register** - User registration ✅
3. **POST /auth/login** - User login ✅

### ❌ Missing AWS Endpoints (Returning 404)
1. **GET /users/profile** - Required for displaying user data
2. **POST /auth/refresh** - Required for session management

### 🔍 Evidence
From the API test, the backend's debug response shows available routes:
```json
"available_routes": [
  "GET /health",
  "POST /auth/register",
  "POST /auth/register-test",
  "POST /auth/login",
  "GET /debug"
]
```

### 🛠️ Frontend Mitigation Steps Taken
1. **Disabled automatic profile fetching** - Prevents 404 errors
2. **Disabled token refresh** - Users will need to re-login after 1 hour
3. **Added MSW mocks** - Allows local development to continue
4. **Store user data from login** - Dashboard can still show basic info

### 🚦 Current Impact
- **Registration**: ✅ Working
- **Login**: ✅ Working
- **Dashboard**: ⚠️ Limited (shows data from login response only)
- **Session Management**: ❌ No auto-refresh (users logout after 1 hour)
- **User Profile Updates**: ❌ Not possible

### 📊 Testing Results
```
Health Check: ✅ 200 OK
Registration: ✅ 201 Created (or 409 if exists)
Login: ✅ 200 OK with JWT tokens
Get Profile: ❌ 404 Not Found
Refresh Token: ❌ 404 Not Found
```

### 🎯 Recommended Actions

#### Option 1: Backend Deploys Missing Endpoints
- Deploy `/users/profile` endpoint
- Deploy `/auth/refresh` endpoint
- Frontend will automatically start working

#### Option 2: Continue with Limited Functionality
- Users can register and login
- Sessions expire after 1 hour (no refresh)
- Dashboard shows limited data
- No profile management

#### Option 3: Full Mock Mode
- Re-enable all MSW mocks
- Full functionality in development
- Deploy to production when backend is ready

### 🔄 Next Steps
Please advise on which option to proceed with. The frontend is ready to integrate as soon as the endpoints are available.

### 📝 Notes
- The backend's PM update claimed all 5 endpoints were deployed
- Only 3 are actually available
- This blocks Week 1 completion as defined in the requirements
