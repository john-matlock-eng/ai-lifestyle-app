# 🎉 AWS API Integration Complete!

Great news! All 5 authentication endpoints are now working. Here's how to verify the complete integration:

## 🧪 Quick Verification Steps

### 1. Start the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Complete Flow

#### Option A: Use the React App
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/register
2. Register a new user with unique email
3. Login with those credentials
4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard
5. Check the browser console - you should see:
   - ✅ AWS endpoints being called (not mocks)
   - ✅ User profile data loaded
   - ✅ No 404 errors

#### Option B: Use the API Test Page
1. Open `test-api.html` in your browser
2. Click through all 5 test buttons:
   - Health Check ✅
   - Registration ✅
   - Login ✅
   - Get Profile ✅
   - Refresh Token ✅

## 📊 What's Working Now

### Full Authentication System:
- **Registration** with validation
- **Login** with JWT tokens
- **Profile Fetching** for dashboard
- **Token Auto-Refresh** (sessions stay active)
- **Protected Routes** with auth checks

### Session Management:
- 1-hour access tokens
- 30-day refresh tokens (with Remember Me)
- Auto-refresh 5 minutes before expiry
- Session timeout warnings
- Idle detection (30 minutes)

## 🎯 Ready for Week 2 Features

The authentication foundation is complete! We can now build:

1. **2FA/MFA Setup UI**
   - QR code generation
   - Backup codes
   - Verification flow

2. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Request reset form
   - Email with reset link
   - Reset confirmation

3. **Profile Management**
   - Update user details
   - Change preferences
   - Security settings

4. **Email Verification**
   - Verification UI
   - Resend functionality
   - 7-day grace period

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

### Check Console Logs
- Look for `[MSW]` messages showing which endpoints are real vs mocked
- Check for any red error messages

### Verify API URL
- Should be: `https://3sfkg1mc0c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- Check `.env.development` file

### Clear Browser Data
- Clear cookies/localStorage
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Token Issues
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh should happen automatically
- If not, try logging out and back in

## 📝 Summary

Week 1 is COMPLETE! The authentication system is fully integrated with AWS and ready for enhancement features. Excellent work by both Frontend and Backend teams! 🎉
