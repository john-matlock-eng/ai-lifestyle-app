# Fix for Duplicate Companion Issue

## Problem
There were two Shih Tzu companions appearing on the login and registration pages:
1. One from `AuthLayout` component (with full features)
2. One from the enhanced forms (creating their own companion)

## Solution
Updated the enhanced forms to use the companion provided by `AuthLayout` instead of creating their own:

### Changes Made:

1. **EnhancedLoginForm.tsx**
   - Added `companion` prop interface
   - Removed internal companion creation
   - Made all companion calls optional with `companion?.method()`

2. **EnhancedRegistrationForm.tsx**
   - Added `companion` prop interface  
   - Removed internal companion creation
   - Made all companion calls optional

3. **LoginPage.tsx**
   - Added state to store companion from AuthLayout
   - Used `onShihTzuReady` callback to get companion instance
   - Passed companion to EnhancedLoginForm

4. **RegisterPage.tsx**
   - Same changes as LoginPage

## Result
Now there's only ONE companion (Ellie) on each page:
- Created and managed by `AuthLayout`
- Passed down to enhanced forms via props
- All features work as expected
- No duplicate companions!

## How It Works
```tsx
// AuthLayout creates the companion
<AuthLayout onShihTzuReady={setCompanion}>
  <EnhancedLoginForm companion={companion} />
</AuthLayout>
```

The companion is now properly shared between the layout and forms, eliminating the duplicate issue while maintaining all the interactive features!
