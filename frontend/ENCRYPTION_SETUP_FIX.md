# Encryption Setup Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Description

After setting up encryption, users were seeing an "Enter Master Password" prompt immediately, and entering the password would result in a 409 error because the system tried to set up encryption again.

## Root Causes

1. **State Synchronization Issue**: After encryption setup in `EncryptionSettings`, the `EncryptionContext` wasn't being notified that encryption was successfully unlocked.

2. **Race Condition**: The `/encryption/check` endpoint could return false due to timing issues, causing the system to think encryption wasn't set up.

3. **Duplicate Key Generation**: When existing local keys were found, the system would try to upload them to the server, causing a 409 error if they already existed.

## Solution Overview

### 1. Added `setupEncryption` Method to EncryptionContext

```typescript
const setupEncryption = async (password: string) => {
  if (!user?.userId) throw new Error("User not authenticated");

  try {
    const encryptionService = getEncryptionService();
    await encryptionService.initialize(password, user.userId);

    // Update local state
    const keyId = await encryptionService.getPublicKeyId();
    setEncryptionKeyId(keyId);
    setIsEncryptionSetup(true);
    setIsEncryptionLocked(false); // Important: unlock after setup
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to setup encryption:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

This ensures that after setup, the global encryption state is properly synchronized.

### 2. Updated EncryptionSettings to Use Context Method

Instead of directly calling the encryption service, `EncryptionSettings` now uses the context method:

```typescript
// Use context setupEncryption which properly updates all state
await contextSetupEncryption(masterPassword);
```

### 3. Improved EncryptionService.initialize Logic

The service now better handles existing local keys:

- **Verifies sync with server**: Checks if local keys match server keys
- **Avoids unnecessary uploads**: Doesn't try to upload keys if they might already exist
- **Handles race conditions**: Gracefully handles cases where server state is temporarily inconsistent

### 4. Better 409 Error Handling in setupNewUser

When creating new encryption keys, if we get a 409:

```typescript
if (axiosError.response?.status === 409) {
  // Fetch server keys and replace our local keys
  const userResponse = await apiClient.get(`/encryption/user/${userId}`);
  const serverData = userResponse.data;
  
  // Replace locally generated keys with server keys
  // Re-derive master key with server salt
  // This ensures we're in sync with the server
}
```

### 5. Removed Confusing 409 Handling from unlockEncryption

Removed the code that treated 409 as "success" in the unlock flow, as this was masking the real issue.

### 6. Added Safeguard to Prevent Unlock Prompt After Setup

```typescript
// Prevent unlock prompt from showing immediately after setup
useEffect(() => {
  if (isEncryptionSetup && !isEncryptionLocked) {
    setHasAttemptedAutoUnlock(true);
  }
}, [isEncryptionSetup, isEncryptionLocked]);
```

## Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Server keys always take precedence over locally generated keys
2. **Avoid Duplicate Operations**: Don't try to set up encryption if it already exists
3. **Proper State Management**: Ensure all encryption state is synchronized through the context
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Provide helpful error messages when keys are out of sync

## Testing the Fix

1. Set up encryption for the first time - should complete without showing unlock prompt
2. Refresh the page - should auto-unlock if "Remember password" was checked
3. Log out and log back in - should show unlock prompt once
4. Enter password - should unlock without errors

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for DynamoDB eventual consistency
2. Implement a "sync status" indicator to show when keys are being synchronized
3. Add better error recovery flows for partial setup states
