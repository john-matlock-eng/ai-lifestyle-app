### 3. **Text Readability** ✅

- Strong drop shadows on all text
- Removed animated gradient text that was hard to read

### 4. **Visual Effects** ✅
- Enhanced CSS for balloon orbs
- Fixed z-index issues
- Added hover effects for stat cards

## 🎈 IMPORTANT: Activate Balloon Theme!

Based on your screenshot, it looks like the balloon theme might not be active. To see all the enhancements:

### Option 1: Use Theme Switcher
Look in your navigation bar for a theme switcher and select "🎈 Balloon"

### Option 2: Set via Console
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('theme-preference', 'balloon');
location.reload();
```

### Option 3: Check if Theme Switcher Exists
If you don't see a theme switcher in the nav, you might need to add it. The component exists at:
`src/components/common/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`

## What You Should See:

When balloon theme is active:
- 🎈 Multiple floating balloon orbs in background
- 🌈 Vibrant purple/pink/turquoise gradients
- ✨ Enhanced hover effects on cards
- 📝 Clear, readable white text on dark backgrounds
- 🎯 Theme indicator showing "balloon" (in dev mode)

## Quick Debug:

1. **Check current theme**: Look at bottom-left corner (in dev mode) - it should say "Theme: balloon"
2. **Inspect background**: Right-click → Inspect → Look for elements with class `animate-float-orb`
3. **Force refresh**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R

## Files Modified:
- `ImprovedDashboardPage.tsx` - Added theme debug indicator
- `QuickStats.tsx` - Fixed overlap and styling
- `DailyHabitTracker.tsx` - Fixed NaN issue
- `dashboard.css` - Enhanced balloon effects

The dashboard is now ready to "pop" with the balloon theme! 🎉
