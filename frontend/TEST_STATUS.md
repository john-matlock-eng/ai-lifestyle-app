   - Updated all testing libraries to React 19 compatible versions

2. **Test Corrections**
   - Fixed validation error text case sensitivity
   - Improved form submission test to verify complete flow

3. **CI/CD Updates**
   - Updated Node version from 18 to 20
   - Changed from `npm ci` to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
