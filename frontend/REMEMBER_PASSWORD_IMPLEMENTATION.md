# Secure Master Password Storage Implementation

## Summary
I've implemented a secure "Remember Password" feature that allows users to store their master encryption password locally on their device. This eliminates the need to enter the password every time while maintaining strong security.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Secure Storage Service** (`securePasswordStorage.ts`)
- Encrypts the master password using AES-GCM with device-specific keys
- Uses browser fingerprinting to generate unique encryption keys per device
- Automatically expires stored passwords after 30 days
- Prevents password portability between devices

### 2. **Updated Unlock UI** (`EncryptionUnlockPrompt.tsx`)
- Added "Remember password on this device (30 days)" checkbox
- Stores password securely when checkbox is selected and unlock succeeds
- Clean, user-friendly interface

### 3. **Auto-Unlock Feature** (`EncryptionContext.tsx`)
- Automatically attempts to unlock encryption on app load if password is stored
- Seamless user experience - no password prompt if stored
- Clears invalid stored passwords automatically

### 4. **Settings Management** (`EncryptionSettings.tsx`)
- New component for encryption settings
- Shows current storage status
- Allows users to manually clear stored passwords
- Provides security information to users

### 5. **Logout Integration** (`useLogout.ts`)
- New hook that properly handles encryption cleanup on logout
- Option to clear stored password on logout

## Security Measures

1. **Device-Specific Encryption**
   - Combines multiple device attributes for fingerprinting
   - Includes persistent random device ID
   - Password can't be copied between devices

2. **Strong Cryptography**
   - PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key derivation
   - AES-GCM 256-bit encryption
   - Secure random IVs for each encryption

3. **Time-Based Security**
   - 30-day automatic expiration
   - Expiration extended on successful use
   - Clear visual indication of storage status

4. **User Control**
   - Opt-in feature (checkbox required)
   - Can manually clear at any time
   - Clear visibility of storage status

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. When prompted for master password, check "Remember password on this device"
2. Password will be stored securely for 30 days
3. Next time you open the app, encryption unlocks automatically
4. Manage stored password in Settings → Encryption Settings

### For Developers:
1. Import `securePasswordStorage` to interact with stored passwords
2. Use `useLogout` hook instead of direct logout for proper cleanup
3. Add `<EncryptionSettings />` component to your settings page

## Integration Example

```tsx
// In your settings page
import { EncryptionSettings } from '@/components/encryption';

function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other settings */}
      <EncryptionSettings />
    </div>
  );
}

// For logout
import { useLogout } from '@/hooks/useLogout';

function Header() {
  const { logout } = useLogout();
  
  const handleLogout = () => {
    // true = clear stored password, false = keep it
    logout(true);
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>;
}
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Browser Storage**: This implementation uses encrypted localStorage, NOT the browser's built-in password manager. This provides better control and security but means:
- Clearing browser data will remove stored passwords
- Passwords are not synced across devices
- Works independently of browser password managers

⚠️ **No localStorage in Artifacts**: If you're testing in Claude.ai artifacts, note that localStorage is not available there. The feature will work properly in a real browser environment.

## Files Modified/Created
1. ✅ Created `securePasswordStorage.ts` - Core storage service
2. ✅ Updated `EncryptionUnlockPrompt.tsx` - Added remember checkbox
3. ✅ Updated `EncryptionContext.tsx` - Added auto-unlock
4. ✅ Updated `EncryptionContextType.ts` - Added clearStoredPassword method
5. ✅ Created `EncryptionSettings.tsx` - Settings UI component
6. ✅ Created `useLogout.ts` - Logout hook with encryption cleanup
7. ✅ Created `PASSWORD_STORAGE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed documentation
8. ✅ Created component exports in `index.ts` files

## Next Steps
1. Add the `EncryptionSettings` component to your settings page
2. Replace logout calls with the `useLogout` hook
3. Test the feature thoroughly in different browsers
4. Consider adding biometric authentication for enhanced security
5. Monitor user feedback and adjust expiration period if needed
