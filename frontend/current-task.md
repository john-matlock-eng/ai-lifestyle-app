# Frontend Current Tasks - Blocked on Backend Architecture Fix

## üö® UPDATE: Real Cause of 404 Errors Identified
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked - But Different Reason
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Severity**: HIGH

### Investigation Results
After investigating with the backend team, we found TWO issues:

1. **Architecture Issue** (Most Critical):
   - Goals implementation violates single-table DynamoDB design
   - Backend is fixing this first (2-4 hours)

2. **Lambda Not Deployed**:
   - The Lambda function isn't deployed (`deploy_lambda=false`)
   - This is why you're getting 404s
   - Will be deployed after architecture fix

### Good News
- ‚úÖ API Gateway routes ARE configured correctly
- ‚úÖ Lambda handler DOES route to goals endpoints  
- ‚úÖ Your goal wizard enhancements are ready to test
- ‚úÖ Backend knows exactly what to fix

### Timeline
- **Morning**: Backend fixes single-table architecture
- **Afternoon**: Backend deploys Lambda with correct table design
- **By EOD**: You should be able to test everything!

## While You Wait - Productive Tasks

### 1. Review Single-Table Design (30 mins)
Understanding how the backend will structure data will help you:
- Design better state management
- Optimize API calls
- Handle relationships between entities

Key patterns:
```
Users:      PK: USER#123,  SK: PROFILE
Goals:      PK: USER#123,  SK: GOAL#456
Activities: PK: USER#123,  SK: ACTIVITY#456#timestamp
```

### 2. Prepare Test Scenarios (1 hour)
Create test plans for when the API is ready:
- [ ] Test all 5 goal patterns (recurring, target, milestone, streak, limit)
- [ ] Test goal CRUD operations
- [ ] Test activity logging with rich context
- [ ] Test progress calculations
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### 3. Enhance Error Handling (1 hour)
Add better error handling to the goal components:
- Network error states
- Validation error display
- Retry mechanisms
- Offline queue for activities

### 4. Design Goal Templates UI (2 hours)
Start designing the UI for goal templates:
- "Drink 8 glasses of water daily"
- "Exercise 30 minutes 3x/week"
- "Meditate 10 minutes daily"
- "Sleep 8 hours nightly"
- "Walk 10,000 steps daily"

### 5. Plan Progress Visualizations (1 hour)
Design charts and visualizations for:
- Streak calendars
- Progress bars with milestones
- Activity heat maps
- Trend lines
- Success rate donuts

## Your Completed Work Still Rocks! üéâ

The goal creation wizard enhancement you completed is excellent:
- ‚úÖ Rich, pattern-specific forms
- ‚úÖ Better UX with fewer steps
- ‚úÖ Proper data transformation
- ‚úÖ Type-safe implementation

This will all work perfectly once the backend is deployed!

## Communication from PM

"Great detective work identifying the 404 issue! We found the root causes:
1. Architecture needs fixing first (single-table design)
2. Lambda isn't deployed yet

Backend is fixing both today. Your wizard enhancements look fantastic and will work perfectly once deployed. Use this time for test prep and enhancements - we'll be testing by end of day!"

**Status**: Blocked but temporary
**Blocker**: Backend architecture fix + deployment
**Your Work**: Complete and ready
**ETA**: Testing by end of day
