## While You Wait (45-60 minutes)

### 1. ðŸŽ¨ Start Task 4: Progress Visualization Design
Even without real data, you can:
- Set up the Recharts components
- Create the chart layouts
- Design the UI with mock data
- Plan the different visualizations for each goal pattern

**Mock Data Structure**:
```typescript
const mockProgress = {
  percentComplete: 75,
  currentStreak: 5,
  longestStreak: 12,
  trend: 'improving',
  periodHistory: [
    { period: '2024-01-01', achieved: true, value: 10000 },
    { period: '2024-01-02', achieved: true, value: 12000 },
    // ...
  ]
};
```

### 2. ðŸ“Š Plan Activity History Component
Design the activity list UI:
- Activity cards with type badges
- Date/time display
- Value and context display
- Pagination controls
- Filter options

### 3. ðŸ§ª Write More Tests
Add test cases for your completed features:
```typescript
describe('UpdateGoalForm', () => {
  it('should update goal title');
  it('should handle validation errors');
  it('should show loading state');
});
```

### 4. ðŸ“± Optimize Mobile Experience
Review and enhance mobile layouts for:
- Goal cards on small screens
- Modal forms on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Swipe gestures for actions?
