## 🚨 Common Integration Issues & Fixes

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
```typescript
// Fix: Ensure token is included
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('accessToken')}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### Issue: 400 Bad Request
```typescript
// Fix: Use camelCase in requests
{
  "goalPattern": "recurring",  // ✅ Correct
  "goal_pattern": "recurring"   // ❌ Wrong
}
```

### Issue: CORS Errors
```typescript
// Backend handles CORS, but ensure:
// - Using correct base URL
// - Not adding extra headers
```

## 📱 Quick API Reference

```typescript
// Types you'll need
interface Goal {
  goalId: string;
  title: string;
  goalPattern: 'recurring' | 'milestone' | 'target' | 'streak' | 'limit';
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'archived';
  // ... see contract for full type
}

interface CreateGoalRequest {
  title: string;
  category: string;
  goalPattern: string;
  target: GoalTarget;
  // ... optional fields
}

interface UpdateGoalRequest {
  // All fields optional
  title?: string;
  status?: 'active' | 'paused';
  // ... see contract
}
```
