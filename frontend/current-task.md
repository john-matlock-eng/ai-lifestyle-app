# Frontend Current Tasks - Goal Creation Wizard Fixed!

## üö® BLOCKER: Goals API Endpoints Not Deployed
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Severity**: HIGH

### Issue Description
Frontend is receiving 404 errors when trying to access goals endpoints:
```
https://3sfkg1mc0c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/goals 
net::ERR_FAILED 404 (Not Found)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the backend's Terraform configuration (`backend/terraform/main.tf`), the goals API routes are **NOT deployed** to API Gateway. 

#### What's Missing:
The API Gateway configuration only includes auth and user endpoints, but is missing ALL goals endpoints:
- `GET /goals` - List user goals
- `POST /goals` - Create new goal
- `GET /goals/{goalId}` - Get goal details
- `PUT /goals/{goalId}` - Update goal
- `DELETE /goals/{goalId}` - Archive goal
- `GET /goals/{goalId}/activities` - List goal activities
- `POST /goals/{goalId}/activities` - Log activity
- `GET /goals/{goalId}/progress` - Get progress

#### What Exists:
- ‚úÖ Goals infrastructure is created (DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets)
- ‚úÖ Goals service module exists in `terraform/services/goals/`
- ‚ùå API Gateway routes are NOT configured
- ‚ùå Lambda handlers for goals endpoints are NOT referenced

### Impact
- Frontend goal creation wizard is complete but cannot save goals
- Users cannot create, view, or track goals
- Core app functionality is blocked

### Action Required from Backend Team
Please add the goals routes to the API Gateway configuration in `backend/terraform/main.tf`. All routes are defined in the OpenAPI contract (`contract/openapi.yaml`) under the Goals section.

## üîß Goal Creation Wizard Enhancement
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

### Issue Fixed
The goal creation wizard was using a generic placeholder `TargetStep` component instead of the complete, feature-rich form components that were already available for each goal pattern.

### What I Changed
**Location**: `frontend/src/features/goals/components/creation/GoalWizard.tsx`

#### 1. Replaced Generic Component with Pattern-Specific Forms
- **Removed**: Generic `TargetStep`, `BasicInfoStep`, `ScheduleStep`, `MotivationStep`, and `ReviewStep` components
- **Added**: Direct integration of the 5 pattern-specific form components:
  - `RecurringGoalForm` - For habits like daily exercise, reading
  - `TargetGoalForm` - For reaching specific values like weight loss
  - `MilestoneGoalForm` - For cumulative achievements
  - `StreakGoalForm` - For consecutive day challenges
  - `LimitGoalForm` - For staying under/over limits

#### 2. Simplified Wizard Flow
- Now only 2 steps instead of 6:
  1. Pattern selection
  2. Pattern-specific form
- Each form handles all its own fields (title, category, target, schedule, etc.)

#### 3. Added Proper Data Transformation
- Created `transformFormDataToRequest` function that correctly maps each pattern's form data to the API contract
- Handles all required fields based on the OpenAPI specification
- Properly sets defaults for each pattern type

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Richer UI**: Each form has pattern-specific features:
  - Quick templates for common goals
  - Visual previews of progress
  - Contextual help and examples
  - Pattern-appropriate terminology

‚úÖ **Better UX**: 
  - Fewer steps to complete
  - More intuitive flow
  - Pattern-specific validation
  - Better visual feedback

‚úÖ **Proper Data Handling**:
  - Correctly structured for API
  - All fields properly mapped
  - Type-safe transformations

### Technical Details
- Fixed imports to use proper form components from `GoalCreator` directory
- Added loading overlay during submission
- Maintained type safety throughout
- Proper error handling with try/catch

### Example Improvements
1. **Recurring Goals**: Now shows frequency selector, days of week picker, and period options
2. **Target Goals**: Shows direction selector (increase/decrease), current value, and progress preview
3. **Streak Goals**: Displays visual streak preview and estimated completion date
4. **Limit Goals**: Shows limit type (max/min) and visual warning zones
5. **Milestone Goals**: Includes progress bar and current value tracking

### Next Steps
1. ~~Test all 5 goal patterns with real data~~ **BLOCKED - API not deployed**
2. Add success notifications after goal creation
3. Consider adding goal templates/presets
4. Implement draft saving functionality

## üöÄ Frontend Deployment Setup Complete!
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-05
**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

### What I Built

#### Terraform Infrastructure
- **Location**: `frontend/terraform/`
- **Components**:
  - S3 bucket for static hosting
  - CloudFront CDN distribution
  - Origin Access Control for secure S3 access
  - ACM certificate support for custom domains
  - Route53 integration (optional)
  - CloudWatch logging (optional)

#### GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`
- **Features**:
  - Automated testing on all PRs
  - Dev environment deployment on PR
  - Production deployment on merge to main
  - Automatic cleanup when PR closed
  - Environment-specific configurations

#### Key Files Created
1. **Infrastructure**:
   - `terraform/main.tf` - Provider configuration
   - `terraform/variables.tf` - Input variables
   - `terraform/s3-cloudfront.tf` - Core resources
   - `terraform/outputs.tf` - Output values
   
2. **Environment Configs**:
   - `terraform/environments/dev.tfvars`
   - `terraform/environments/prod.tfvars`
   - `terraform/backend-dev.conf`
   - `terraform/backend-prod.conf`

3. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `terraform/deploy.sh` - Manual deployment script
   - `terraform/generate-env.sh` - Environment config generator

4. **Documentation**:
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step setup guide
   - `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` - Backend coordination requirements

### Next Steps for Full Integration

#### 1. Backend Coordination Required ü§ù
The backend team needs to:
- ~~Share the API Gateway URL~~ ‚úÖ Done
- ~~Provide Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID~~ ‚úÖ Done
- ~~Configure CORS to allow CloudFront domains~~ ‚úÖ Done
- **Deploy goals API endpoints** ‚ùå Missing!

#### 2. Update Configuration
Once you have the backend values:
```bash
# Edit frontend/terraform/environments/dev.tfvars
api_url              = "https://actual-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
cognito_user_pool_id = "us-east-1_xxxxxxxxx"
cognito_client_id    = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

#### 3. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd frontend/terraform
terraform init -backend-config=backend-dev.conf
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

#### 4. Setup GitHub Secrets
Add to your repository:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Benefits of This Setup

‚úÖ **Automated Deployments**: Push code, get deployed
‚úÖ **Preview Environments**: Every PR gets its own URL
‚úÖ **Fast Global Access**: CloudFront CDN
‚úÖ **Secure**: S3 not public, HTTPS only
‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: ~$1-5/month for dev
‚úÖ **Scalable**: Handles millions of users
