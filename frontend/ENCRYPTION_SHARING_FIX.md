# Encryption Key Mismatch False Positive Fix

## Problem Description

Users were seeing "Encryption Keys Out of Sync" error when trying to share entries, even though the displayed keys were identical (both showing `2cceb2fe...`). This was preventing users from sharing encrypted journal entries.

## Root Cause

1. **Backend API Mismatch**: The `/encryption/user/{userId}` endpoint returns only public key information (via `get_user_public_key` handler), not the full encryption data including salt and encrypted private key.

2. **False Positive Detection**: The `useEncryptionMismatchDetection` hook was checking for `salt` and `encryptedPrivateKey` fields that don't exist in the public key response, causing `hasIncompleteData` to always be true.

3. **Error Handling**: When the API call failed (404), the hook was incorrectly treating it as a key mismatch instead of checking other sources.

## Solution

### 1. **Improved Response Detection**
Added logic to detect if the response is a public-key-only response:
```typescript
const isPublicKeyOnlyResponse = serverData.hasEncryption !== undefined || 
                               (serverData.publicKey && !serverData.salt && !serverData.encryptedPrivateKey);
```

When detected, only compare public key IDs, not the full encryption data.

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
When the encryption endpoint returns 404:
- Check the user profile to see if encryption is actually enabled
- Don't assume mismatch on network errors
- Default to no mismatch to avoid false positives

### 3. **Normalized Key Comparison**
- Handle case sensitivity: `toLowerCase()`
- Trim whitespace: `.trim()`
- Support both camelCase and snake_case field names from backend

### 4. **Enhanced UI Feedback**
- Show both beginning and end of keys: `${key.slice(0, 8)}...${key.slice(-4)}`
- Display warning when keys appear identical
- Better logging for debugging

## Key Changes

### `useEncryptionMismatchDetection.ts`
1. Added public-key-only response detection
2. Improved error handling for 404s
3. Added normalized key comparison
4. Enhanced logging

### `ShareDialog.tsx`
1. Better key display (showing start and end)
2. Warning when keys appear identical
3. Clearer error messages

## Testing

1. **Share Entry**: Try sharing an encrypted entry - should work without false mismatch
2. **Check Console**: Look for detailed comparison logs
3. **Key Display**: Verify keys show properly in error dialog (if real mismatch)

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Consistency**: Create a dedicated endpoint for full encryption data
2. **Caching**: Cache encryption status to reduce API calls
3. **Better Error Messages**: Distinguish between different types of mismatches
