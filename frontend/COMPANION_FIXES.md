# Companion Animation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error
- **Cause**: The `showCuriosity()` call in `useAuthShihTzu` was triggering during render, causing an infinite loop
- **Fix**: Wrapped the initial greeting in a `setTimeout` and added a `hasGreeted` ref to ensure it only runs once

### 2. AnimatedShihTzu Position Update Loop
- **Cause**: The position effect had dependencies that could change on every render
- **Fix**: 
  - Only depend on `position.x` and `position.y` values instead of the entire position object
  - Removed `onPositionChange` and `currentPosition` from dependencies
  - Added proper cleanup for position timer

### 3. Mood Sync Issues
- **Cause**: The mood sync effect included `currentMood` in dependencies, creating a loop
- **Fix**: Only depend on the `mood` prop, not the `currentMood` state

### 4. AuthLayout Re-render Issues
- **Cause**: The `onShihTzuReady` callback could be called multiple times
- **Fix**: Added `readyCallbackRef` to ensure the callback is only called once

## Key Improvements:

1. **Proper Effect Dependencies**: All `useEffect` hooks now have correct dependencies to prevent loops
2. **Timeout Management**: All timeouts are properly cleared on cleanup
3. **Debouncing**: Typing and password strength changes are debounced to prevent rapid state changes
4. **State Management**: Companion state is managed separately from mood to prevent conflicts
5. **Reference Stability**: Using refs to track whether actions have been performed

## Testing:

To test the fixes:
1. Navigate to `/auth-test` to see the debug panel
2. The companion should:
   - Greet once on mount (curious mood for 3 seconds)
   - Move smoothly to focused fields
   - Show appropriate moods for password strength
   - Not flicker between states
   - Return to idle when not interacting

## Debug Features Added:

1. **Test Navigation Component**: Shows in development mode (bottom left)
2. **Debug Panel in AuthTestPage**: Shows companion state, mood, position, and manual controls
3. **Console Logging**: No more infinite loop errors in the console
