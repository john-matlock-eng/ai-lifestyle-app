# Enhanced Companion Test Page

## Overview
The enhanced companion system has been integrated into the Auth Test Page (`/auth-test`) for testing and fine-tuning before rolling out to the entire application.

## What's New

### Visual Enhancements
- **9 Enhanced Moods**: idle, happy, curious, excited, playful, zen, proud, concerned, celebrating
- **Particle Effects**: Hearts, sparkles, treats, and sleep (zzz) particles
- **Thought Bubbles**: Companion can express thoughts and emotions
- **Accessories**: Party hat for celebrations
- **Variants**: Default, winter, party, and workout color schemes
- **Petting Interaction**: Click the companion to pet it!

### Personality System
- **Happiness Meter**: Tracks companion's overall happiness
- **Attention Needs**: Decreases over time, increases with interaction
- **Bond Level**: Grows with each interaction

### Smart Behaviors
- **Context-Aware Thoughts**: Different messages for email vs password fields
- **Password Strength Reactions**: Visual feedback as password gets stronger
- **Error Handling**: Concerned reactions with helpful messages
- **Success Celebrations**: Victory dance with party hat!
- **Typing Encouragement**: Random encouraging messages while typing

## How to Test

1. **Navigate to the test page**: `http://localhost:5173/auth-test`

2. **Use the Debug Panel** (top right):
   - Toggle between enhanced and basic modes
   - View real-time companion stats
