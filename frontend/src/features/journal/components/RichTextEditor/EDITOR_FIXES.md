# Rich Text Editor Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Floating/Bubble Menu Overlapping Text Area
- **Problem**: The hover menus (bubble and floating) were appearing on top of the text input area, making it impossible to type
- **Solution**: 
  - Disabled both menus by default (`showBubbleMenu={false}`, `showFloatingMenu={false}`)
  - Added typing detection to hide menus while user is typing
  - Increased delays and offsets for menus when enabled
  - Added proper z-index management

### 2. DOM Manipulation Error ("removeChild" error)
- **Problem**: Typing a single character caused a React/TipTap DOM conflict resulting in a crash
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved focus management with proper event handling
  - Added typing state management with debouncing
  - Fixed toolbar button click handlers to maintain editor focus
  - Added `onCreate` handler to ensure proper initialization

## Key Changes

1. **Default Settings**: Both bubble and floating menus are now disabled by default to prevent interference

2. **Typing Detection**: Added a typing state that:
   - Activates when user types
   - Prevents menus from showing while typing
   - Resets after 1.5 seconds of inactivity

3. **Focus Management**: 
   - Toolbar buttons now properly maintain editor focus
   - Removed setTimeout delays that could cause timing issues
   - Added preventDefault on mouseDown to prevent focus loss

4. **Menu Positioning**: When enabled, menus now have:
   - Longer delays (800ms for bubble, standard for floating)
   - Better offsets to avoid text overlap
   - Higher z-index (9999) to ensure visibility

## Usage Recommendations

For the journal editor, it's recommended to keep the menus disabled:
```tsx
<RichTextEditor
  content={value}
  onChange={onChange}
  showToolbar={true}      // Keep toolbar visible
  showBubbleMenu={false}  // Disable to prevent issues
  showFloatingMenu={false} // Disable to prevent issues
/>
```

If you need the menus, enable them selectively and test thoroughly:
```tsx
<RichTextEditor
  content={value}
  onChange={onChange}
  showToolbar={true}
  showBubbleMenu={true}   // Only if needed
  showFloatingMenu={false} // Usually more problematic
/>
```

## Testing

The editor should now:
- Allow typing without any menu interference
- Not crash when entering text
- Maintain proper focus when using toolbar buttons
- Show menus only when appropriate (if enabled)
