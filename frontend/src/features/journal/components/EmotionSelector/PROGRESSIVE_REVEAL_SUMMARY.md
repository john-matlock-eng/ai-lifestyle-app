# Progressive Reveal Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Emotion Wheel now features a progressive reveal mode that guides users through a structured emotion selection process. This helps users narrow down their emotions from broad categories to specific feelings.

## How It Works

### 1. Initial State

- Only core emotions (center of wheel) are visible and selectable
- Other tiers are dimmed with reduced opacity (0.3)
- Cursor shows "not-allowed" for non-selectable emotions

### 2. Core Emotion Selection

- User clicks a core emotion (e.g., "Happy", "Sad", "Angry")
- The selected core emotion becomes focused
- Only its secondary emotions become visible and selectable
- Other core emotions are dimmed

### 3. Secondary Emotion Selection

- User selects a secondary emotion within the focused core
- The selected secondary emotion becomes focused
- Only its tertiary emotions become visible and selectable
- Other secondary emotions are dimmed

### 4. Tertiary Emotion Selection

- User selects one or more specific tertiary emotions
- "Complete Selection" and "Add Another Emotion" buttons appear
- User can either complete the current selection or start a new one

## Key Features

### Visual Feedback

- **Opacity changes**: Non-selectable emotions are dimmed (opacity 0.3)
- **Cursor feedback**: Shows pointer for selectable, not-allowed for non-selectable
- **Stroke width**: Focused emotions have thicker borders
- **Progress indicator**: Shows current step in the selection process

### Interaction States

- **Unfocus behavior**: Clicking a focused emotion unfocuses it and clears child selections
- **Hierarchical clearing**: Deselecting a parent clears all child selections
- **Multiple tertiary selection**: Users can select multiple tertiary emotions before completing

### UI Elements

- **Dynamic instructions**: Text in center changes based on selection state
- **Progress indicator**: Visual breadcrumb showing selection progress
- **Action buttons**: "Complete Selection" and "Add Another" appear after tertiary selection

## Code Changes

### State Management

```typescript
const [focusedCoreEmotion, setFocusedCoreEmotion] = useState<string | null>(
  null,
);
const [focusedSecondaryEmotion, setFocusedSecondaryEmotion] = useState<
  string | null
>(null);
```

### Selection Logic

- Enhanced `handleEmotionSelect` function with progressive reveal logic
- Conditional rendering based on focused emotions
- Clear separation between progressive and standard modes

### Visual Rendering

- Conditional opacity based on focus state
- Dynamic cursor classes
- Progressive filtering of visible emotions

## Usage

```typescript
<EmotionWheel
  selectedEmotions={selectedEmotions}
  onEmotionToggle={handleEmotionToggle}
  progressiveReveal={true}  // Enable progressive reveal
  onComplete={handleComplete}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Guided Experience**: Users are led through a structured selection process
2. **Reduced Overwhelm**: Only relevant options are shown at each step
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Visual representation of emotion relationships
4. **Better Specificity**: Encourages users to identify specific emotions
5. **Intuitive Flow**: Natural progression from general to specific

## Demo

A demo component (`EmotionWheelProgressiveDemo.tsx`) is available to test and showcase the progressive reveal functionality with toggle controls and visual feedback.
