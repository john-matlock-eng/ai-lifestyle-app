# Emotion Wheel Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Reset Zoom on ESC or Click Outside

- **Problem**: The feelings wheel zoom level persisted even when the user wanted to reset it
- **Solution**:
  - Added ESC key handler to reset zoom to default (1.0)
  - Added click-outside handler to reset zoom when clicking anywhere outside the emotion wheel container
  - Added a reset button with the RotateCcw icon for explicit reset action

### 2. Zoom Controls Accessibility

- **Problem**: When zoomed in, the zoom controls could be covered by the wheel itself, making them inaccessible
- **Solution**:
  - Moved zoom controls outside the zoomable container
  - Positioned them above the wheel using `absolute -top-12 right-0`
  - Increased z-index to `z-20` to ensure they stay on top
  - Added padding-top to the container to accommodate the controls

## Additional Improvements

1. **Disabled State for Buttons**: Added disabled states for zoom buttons when at min/max zoom levels
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Added CSS transition for zoom changes for better UX
3. **Visual Feedback**: The reset button is disabled when zoom is at default (1.0)
4. **Responsive Design**: Updated CSS to maintain proper spacing on mobile devices

## Usage

The emotion wheel now behaves more intuitively:

- Zoom in/out using the buttons
- Press ESC at any time to reset zoom
- Click anywhere outside the wheel to reset zoom
- Use the reset button for explicit reset action
- Zoom controls remain accessible at all zoom levels

## CSS Changes

Added styles for:

- Container padding to accommodate repositioned controls
- Disabled button states
- Smooth zoom transitions
- Responsive adjustments
