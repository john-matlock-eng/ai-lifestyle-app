# Hierarchical Emotion Selection - Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Parent Selection**

When selecting a child emotion, all parent emotions are automatically selected:

- Selecting "Optimistic" (tertiary) → auto-selects "Joyful" (secondary) and "Happy" (core)
- Selecting "Peaceful" (secondary) → auto-selects "Happy" (core)
- This ensures emotional states are logically consistent

### 2. **Visual Encouragement for Core Emotions**

When no emotions are selected:

- Core emotions have a subtle **pulse animation** to draw attention
- Text prompt appears: "Start by selecting a core emotion"
- Core emotions have thicker borders in empty state

### 3. **Hierarchical Display of Selected Emotions**

Selected emotions are now grouped and displayed hierarchically:

- **Core emotions**: Larger pills with stronger colors and shadows
- **Secondary emotions**: Shown with › indicator, slightly indented
- **Tertiary emotions**: Shown with ›› indicator, more indented
- Clear visual hierarchy shows relationships

### 4. **Configuration Options**

```tsx
// Enable/disable hierarchical selection
<EmotionWheel
  selectedEmotions={emotions}
  onEmotionToggle={handleToggle}
  hierarchicalSelection={true} // Default: true
/>
```

## Visual Changes

### CSS Additions

- Pulse animation for core emotions when empty
- Hierarchical styling for emotion pills
- Visual indicators (›, ››) for emotion levels
- Different sizes and opacity for each level

### Interactive Elements

- Toggle in demo to enable/disable hierarchical selection
- Clear all button for resetting selections
- Improved visual feedback during selection

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Guided Selection Flow**: Users are encouraged to start broad (core) then get specific
2. **Logical Consistency**: Prevents illogical states (e.g., feeling "ecstatic" but not "happy")
3. **Faster Selection**: Auto-selection reduces clicks needed
4. **Clear Relationships**: Visual hierarchy shows how emotions relate

## Technical Implementation

### Selection Logic

```typescript
const handleEmotionSelect = (emotionId: string) => {
  if (selectedEmotions.includes(emotionId)) {
    // Deselecting - just remove this emotion
    onEmotionToggle(emotionId);
  } else {
    // Selecting - auto-select all parents first
    if (hierarchicalSelection && emotion.parent) {
      // Get parent chain and select from core → specific
      const parents = getParentChain(emotion);
      parents.forEach((parentId) => onEmotionToggle(parentId));
    }
    onEmotionToggle(emotionId);
  }
};
```

## Try It Out

In the demo:

1. Notice core emotions pulsing when nothing is selected
2. Click on a tertiary emotion (outer ring) - watch parents auto-select
3. Toggle hierarchical selection off to see the difference
4. Observe the hierarchical grouping in selected emotions display

This creates a more intuitive and meaningful emotion selection experience!
