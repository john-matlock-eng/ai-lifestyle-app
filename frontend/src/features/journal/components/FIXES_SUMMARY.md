# Journal Editor Issues - Summary of Fixes

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. Emotion Wheel Issues

**Problems:**

- Zoom controls became inaccessible when zoomed in

**Solutions:**

- Added ESC key handler to reset zoom

- Moved zoom controls outside the zoomable container (positioned above)
- Added reset button with visual feedback
- Smooth transitions for better UX

### 2. Rich Text Editor Issues

**Problems:**

- Floating/bubble menus appeared over the text input area
- Typing caused DOM manipulation errors and crashed the page
- React and TipTap were fighting over DOM control

**Solutions:**

- Disabled bubble and floating menus by default
- Added typing detection to hide menus during input
- Improved focus management and event handling
- Fixed toolbar button handlers to maintain editor focus
- Added proper initialization with onCreate handler

## Implementation Details

### Emotion Wheel (`EmotionWheel.tsx`)

- Implemented keyboard event listener for ESC key
- Added click-outside event listener
- Repositioned controls with `absolute -top-12 right-0`
- Updated CSS for proper spacing

### Rich Text Editor (`RichTextEditor.tsx`)

- Changed default props: `showBubbleMenu={false}`, `showFloatingMenu={false}`
- Added `isTyping` state with debounced timeout
- Improved `executeCommand` to maintain focus
- Added better positioning for menus when enabled
- Fixed event handling to prevent focus loss

### Section Editor (`SectionEditor.tsx`)

## Testing

Use the provided test pages to verify fixes:

- `EmotionWheelDemo.tsx` - Test emotion wheel zoom functionality
- `RichTextEditorTestPage.tsx` - Test editor without crashes

## Recommendations

1. Keep bubble and floating menus disabled unless specifically needed
2. If menus are needed, test thoroughly in your specific use case
3. Monitor for any DOM manipulation errors in the console
4. Consider using only the static toolbar for formatting options

The editor should now be stable and usable without the previous issues.
