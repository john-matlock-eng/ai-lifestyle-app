# Master Password Storage Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to securely store their master encryption password locally on their device, eliminating the need to enter it every time they use the application. The password is stored using strong encryption with device-specific keys.

## Security Implementation

### 1. Device-Specific Encryption
- The master password is encrypted using AES-GCM with a 256-bit key
- The encryption key is derived from device fingerprinting data:
  - Browser user agent
  - Language settings
  - Platform information
  - Screen dimensions
  - Timezone
  - A unique device ID (generated once and persisted)

### 2. Key Derivation
- Uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- SHA-256 hash algorithm
- Salt: "ai-lifestyle-secure-storage"

### 3. Storage Details
- Stored in browser's localStorage (encrypted)
- Automatic expiration after 30 days
- Expiration is extended on each successful use

### 4. Security Features
- Password never stored in plain text
- Device-specific encryption prevents copying between devices
- Automatic cleanup on expiration
- Can be manually cleared by user
- Cleared on logout (optional)

## User Experience

### Enabling Password Storage
1. User enters master password in unlock prompt
2. Checks "Remember password on this device (30 days)"
3. Password is encrypted and stored locally

### Automatic Unlock
- On app load, if password is stored and valid:
  - Automatically attempts to unlock encryption
  - No user interaction required
  - If password is invalid (changed), storage is cleared

### Managing Stored Password
- Users can view storage status in encryption settings
- Can manually clear stored password
- Can see when password will expire
- Option to clear on logout

## Implementation Files

### Core Components
1. **securePasswordStorage.ts** - Core storage service
   - Handles encryption/decryption
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Expiration management

2. **EncryptionUnlockPrompt.tsx** - Updated UI
   - Added "Remember password" checkbox
   - Stores password on successful unlock

3. **EncryptionContext.tsx** - Auto-unlock logic
   - Attempts auto-unlock on app load
   - Manages unlock state

4. **EncryptionSettings.tsx** - Settings UI
   - Shows storage status
   - Allows manual clearing

5. **useLogout.ts** - Logout hook
   - Option to clear stored password on logout

## Security Considerations

### Threats Mitigated
- ✅ Password theft from localStorage (encrypted)
- ✅ Cross-device password copying (device-specific keys)
- ✅ Long-term storage risks (30-day expiration)
- ✅ Unauthorized access (requires initial authentication)

### Remaining Risks
- ⚠️ Physical device access (mitigated by device lock screens)
- ⚠️ Browser vulnerabilities (use latest browser versions)
- ⚠️ Malicious browser extensions (educate users)

## Browser Compatibility
- Requires Web Crypto API support
- Works in all modern browsers:
  - Chrome/Edge 37+
  - Firefox 34+
  - Safari 10.1+
  - Opera 24+

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test password storage and retrieval
2. Verify 30-day expiration
3. Test device fingerprint changes
4. Verify cleanup on logout
5. Test invalid password handling
6. Cross-browser testing

## Future Enhancements
1. Configurable expiration period
2. Biometric authentication integration
3. Multiple device management
4. Password change notifications
5. Enhanced device fingerprinting
