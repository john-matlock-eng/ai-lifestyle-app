## Migration Checklist

### Before Starting:

- [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/enhanced-companion`
- [ ] Set up feature flag: `ENHANCED_COMPANION_ENABLED`
- [ ] Backup current companion code
- [ ] Review with team

### During Development:

- [ ] Keep existing companion working
- [ ] Test on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Before Merging:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team demo completed
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

## Code Migration Examples

### Example 1: Updating Auth Pages

```typescript
// Before
const companion = useAuthShihTzu();

// After (Phase 1 - compatible)
const companion = useEnhancedCompanion({
  // Enhanced features
  enableAI: true,
  enableSound: true,
});

// The companion still works with existing auth integration
companion.handleInputFocus(element); // Still works
companion.greetUser(userName); // New enhanced version
```

### Example 2: Adding to Existing Components

```typescript
// Add to Dashboard.tsx
import { useCompanion } from "@/contexts/CompanionContext";

const Dashboard = () => {
  const companion = useCompanion();

  useEffect(() => {
    // New behavior without breaking existing
    companion.greetUser(currentUser.name);
  }, []);

  // Existing dashboard code...
};
```

### Example 3: Progressive Enhancement

```typescript
// Start with basic integration
companion.celebrate(); // Works immediately

// Add enhanced features gradually
companion.celebrateAchievement("goal", {
  difficulty: "hard",
}); // Enhanced version

// Add personality features when ready
if (companion.personality) {
  companion.updateNeed("attention", 100);
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:

1. **Performance on low-end devices**
   - Solution: Reduced animation mode
   - Disable particles on mobile

2. **User confusion with new features**
   - Solution: Gradual rollout
   - Clear onboarding

3. **Breaking existing integrations**
   - Solution: Backward compatibility layer
   - Extensive testing

### Rollback Plan:

1. Keep old companion code in `legacy/` folder
2. Feature flag to disable enhanced version
3. Quick revert mechanism in place

## Success Metrics

### Week 1-2 Goals:

- No regression in existing functionality
- Enhanced animations working smoothly
- Positive team feedback

### Week 3-4 Goals:

- 20% increase in companion interactions
- Personality system stable
- App-wide integration complete

### Week 5-6 Goals:

- 50% of users interacting daily
- Positive user feedback
- Performance targets met

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create companion types file
   - Set up feature branch
   - Build enhanced component

2. **Team Coordination**:
   - Design review for new moods
   - Sound asset creation
   - Analytics setup

3. **User Research**:
   - Beta test with power users
   - Gather feedback on personality
   - A/B test engagement features

Remember: The goal is to create a companion that users will miss when it's not there! üêï‚ú®
