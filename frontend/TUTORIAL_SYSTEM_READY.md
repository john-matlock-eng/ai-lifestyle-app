# ✅ Tutorial System Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
The shih tzu companion wasn't being rendered on the dashboard page. The companion hook only manages state - it doesn't render the visual component.

## What I Fixed
1. Created `CompanionProvider` to render the companion
2. Wrapped the dashboard with this provider
3. Connected the companion to the tutorial system

## Quick Test
1. **Go to your dashboard** - You should now see:
   - 🐕 The shih tzu companion (right side of screen)
   - 📋 A tutorial panel showing "Dashboard Introduction"
   - 🔧 Debug buttons in the bottom-left corner

2. **The tutorial is currently forced to show** for testing. Once you confirm it's working, remove line 575 in DashboardPage.tsx:
   ```typescript
   // Remove this line after confirming tutorials work:
   debugStartTutorial="dashboard_intro"
   ```

3. **Test the debug buttons** in the bottom-left corner:
   - "Start Encryption Tutorial"
   - "Start Dashboard Intro"
   - "Start Habit Tutorial"

## For New Users
Once you remove the debug line, new users will automatically see:
1. Encryption setup tutorial (30-second timeout)
2. Dashboard introduction
3. Habit creation encouragement

The companion will guide them through each step with appropriate moods and animations!

Let me know if you see the companion and tutorial panel now! 🎉
