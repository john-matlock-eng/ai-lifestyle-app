.hover-lift        /* Smooth lift animation on hover */
.animate-pulse-glow /* Pulsing glow animation */
.animate-float     /* Gentle floating animation */
```

### 5. Special Effects

#### Vibrant Theme Background
The vibrant theme includes a subtle animated gradient background that shifts opacity for a dynamic feel without being distracting.

#### Glass Morphism
Available as a utility class for overlays and modal backgrounds, creating a modern frosted glass effect.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Replace theme.css
The new theme.css file includes all enhanced CSS variables and theme definitions.

### 2. Update Components
- **Button.tsx**: Updated with new variant styles and animations
- **GoalCard.tsx**: + Log button now uses primary variant for visibility
- **ThemeSelector.tsx**: New component with visual theme previews

### 3. Update Tailwind Config
Add the new CSS variables to your color palette if needed:
```javascript
colors: {
  'surface-hover': 'var(--surface-hover)',
  'text-secondary': 'var(--text-secondary)',
  'text-disabled': 'var(--text-disabled)',
  // ... etc
}
```

### 4. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test all themes for proper contrast ratios
- [ ] Verify hover states work correctly
- [ ] Check focus states for accessibility
- [ ] Test glass morphism effects in different browsers
- [ ] Ensure animations are smooth and performant

## Migration Tips

1. **Gradual Migration**: You can implement these changes incrementally
2. **Browser Support**: Glass morphism requires backdrop-filter support
3. **Performance**: The vibrant theme's background animation is GPU-accelerated
4. **Accessibility**: All themes maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios

## Theme Usage Examples

### Using Glass Effect
```jsx
<div className="glass p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h3 className="text-gradient">Beautiful Glass Card</h3>
  <p className="text-secondary">With backdrop blur effect</p>
</div>
```

### Animated Buttons
```jsx
<Button variant="primary" className="animate-pulse-glow">
  Important Action
</Button>
```

### Hover Effects
```jsx
<div className="hover-lift bg-surface p-4 rounded-lg">
  <p>This card lifts on hover</p>
</div>
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Theme transition animations when switching themes
2. Custom theme creator for users
3. Auto-theme based on time of day
4. Theme-specific icons and illustrations
5. Animated backgrounds for other themes

## Performance Considerations

- CSS variables ensure instant theme switching
- Animations use transform and opacity for best performance
- Glass effects are optional and can be disabled on low-end devices
- All gradients are CSS-based, no image assets needed

## Conclusion

This enhanced theme system transforms your app from functional to fantastic, creating a "wow" experience while maintaining excellent readability and accessibility. The vibrant theme especially showcases what's possible with modern CSS, while other themes provide options for different moods and preferences.
