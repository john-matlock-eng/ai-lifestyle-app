### 🚧 In Progress / Partially Complete

#### State Management Decision
- ⚠️ Currently using React Query exclusively
- ⚠️ Implementation guide suggests Redux integration
- **Decision Needed**: Stick with React Query or add Redux?

#### User Stats Endpoint
- ⚠️ Frontend expects `/users/stats` endpoint
- ⚠️ Currently stats are bundled with habit responses
- **Need**: Dedicated Lambda for user statistics

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### Frontend Pages (50% Complete)
1. **Habit Management Pages**
   - ✅ `/habits` - Main habits list page with filters and stats
   - ✅ `/habits/new` - Create new habit form with tips
   - ✅ `/habits/:id/edit` - Edit habit with delete confirmation
   - ❌ `/habits/manage` - Bulk management interface
   - ❌ `/habits/analytics` - Detailed analytics dashboard
   - ❌ `/habits/rewards` - Achievements and rewards page

2. **UI Components Needed**
   - ✅ `HabitForm.tsx` - Create/edit habit form with icon/color pickers
   - ✅ `HabitsPage.tsx` - Full habits list with filters and stats
   - ❌ `HabitAnalytics.tsx` - Analytics visualizations
   - ❌ `AchievementModal.tsx` - Achievement unlock modal
   - ❌ `HabitDeleteConfirm.tsx` - Delete confirmation dialog
   - ❌ `HabitReorder.tsx` - Drag-and-drop reordering

3. **Features Not Implemented**
   - ❌ Sound effects for completions
   - ❌ Push notifications/reminders
   - ❌ Habit templates/presets
   - ❌ Habit sharing/social features
   - ❌ Export habit data
   - ❌ Habit correlations visualization
   - ❌ Time-of-day optimization

#### Backend Missing Pieces
1. **Lambda Functions**
   - ❌ `get_user_stats` - Dedicated user statistics endpoint
   - ❌ `reorder_habits` - Update display order
   - ❌ `get_habit_templates` - Preset habit templates

2. **Advanced Features**
   - ❌ ML-based habit recommendations
   - ❌ Correlation analysis between habits
   - ❌ Optimal time-of-day suggestions
   - ❌ Team/group habit tracking

### 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Redux Store Configuration**
   - The store doesn't include `habitSlice`
   - Need to decide on state management approach

2. **Backend Compatibility** (FIXED ✅)
   - ~~Pydantic v2 requires `pattern` instead of `regex` in Field definitions~~
   - ~~JWT claims path in Lambda handlers needs to include `jwt` level~~
   - ~~DynamoDB keys must be lowercase (`pk`/`sk`) not uppercase~~

3. **Error Handling**
   - Need better error messages for users
   - Toast notifications for success/failure

4. **Performance**
   - Consider pagination for users with many habits
   - Optimize animations for mobile devices

### 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create Habit Management Pages** (High Priority)
   - [x] Create `HabitForm` component
   - [x] Implement `/habits/new` page
   - [x] Implement `/habits` list page
   - [x] Add edit functionality
   
2. **Add Notification System** (High Priority)
   - [ ] Create Toast component
   - [ ] Add success/error feedback
   - [ ] Integrate with habit actions

2. **Fix State Management** (Medium Priority)
   - [ ] Decide: Redux or React Query only
   - [ ] If Redux: implement `habitSlice`
   - [ ] Ensure consistent state updates

3. **Implement User Stats** (Medium Priority)
   - [ ] Create `get_user_stats` Lambda
   - [ ] Update frontend to use dedicated endpoint
   - [ ] Add more detailed statistics

4. **Polish & UX** (Low Priority)
   - [ ] Add sound effects
   - [ ] Implement achievement modals
   - [ ] Add loading states
   - [ ] Improve error messages

5. **Advanced Features** (Future)
   - [ ] Analytics dashboard
   - [ ] Habit correlations
   - [ ] AI recommendations
   - [ ] Social features

### 🔧 Development Notes

#### To Run Locally
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend (for testing Lambda functions)

#### Design Decisions
1. **Glass Morphism UI**: Maintaining consistency with app theme

3. **Points System**: 10 points per completion, bonus for streaks
4. **Streak Logic**: Reset at midnight, 7-day milestones celebrated
