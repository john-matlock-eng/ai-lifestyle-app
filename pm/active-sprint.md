# Active Sprint Status - Week 3

## ‚úÖ Blocker Resolved: Backend Contract Fix Deployed

### Date: January 8, 2025 (15:00 UTC)
**Sprint Goal**: Testing & Optimization Phase
**Current Status**: ACTIVE - Frontend unblocked

## Background: Contract Violation (Resolved)

### Problem
Backend's activity logging endpoint expects snake_case fields (`activity_type`, `activity_date`) but the OpenAPI contract specifies camelCase fields (`activityType`, `activityDate`).

### Impact
- Frontend could not log activities
- Progress tracking blocked
- Activity history blocked
- 60% of goal features unusable

### Resolution
Backend models updated to use camelCase and API redeployed. Frontend is unblocked.

## Week 3 Progress Update

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Architecture Fixed**: Single-table design implemented
2. **API Deployed**: All endpoints live with JWT auth
3. **Frontend Tasks 1-2**: Goal editing and archiving working
4. **Infrastructure**: Everything deployed and healthy

### üöÄ Current Focus
1. Integrate progress charts with real data
2. Build activity history list
3. Polish goal creation wizard

### Team Status
### Backend Team
- **Immediate Priority**: Monitor API logs
- **Status**: Deployment stable
- **ETA**: n/a

### Frontend Team
- **Status**: Implementing progress features
- **Completed**: Tasks 1-3 (edit, actions, logging)
- **Next**: Finish progress charts and history

## Contract Compliance Reminder

### The Law of the Contract üìú
```yaml
# OpenAPI Contract says:
activityType: string    # camelCase ‚úÖ
activityDate: string    # camelCase ‚úÖ

# NOT:
activity_type: string   # snake_case ‚ùå
activity_date: string   # snake_case ‚ùå
```

### Why This Matters
1. **Type Safety**: Frontend generates types from contract
2. **Integration**: Contract is our integration agreement
3. **Trust**: Teams rely on contract accuracy
4. **Future**: Other consumers will use same contract
