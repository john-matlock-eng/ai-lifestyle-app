# Active Sprint Status - Week 3

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED

### Date: January 7, 2025
**Sprint Goal**: Testing & Optimization Phase
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Goals API not deployed

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issue: Goals API Routes Missing from API Gateway

### Problem
- Frontend attempting to use goals endpoints getting 404 errors
- All 8 goal endpoints are implemented but NOT exposed via API Gateway
- Frontend team completely blocked from testing goal features

### Root Cause
- Terraform configuration missing goals routes in API Gateway
- Lambda handlers exist but no API Gateway integration configured

### Action Required
- Backend team must add goals routes to `terraform/main.tf`
- Deploy immediately to unblock frontend
- Estimated time: 30 minutes

### Impact
- Frontend cannot test completed goal creation wizard
- No goal functionality available to users
- Integration testing blocked
- Sprint velocity at risk

## Week 2 Recap

### âœ… Major Accomplishments
1. **Authentication Module**: Complete with 2FA
2. **Goal System Contract**: All 8 endpoints defined
3. **Goal System Implementation**: Backend complete (3.5 hours!)
4. **Frontend Goal UI**: Creation wizard enhanced
5. **Deployment Infrastructure**: S3 + CloudFront ready

### ðŸš§ Current Blockers
1. **Goals API Deployment**: Routes not in API Gateway (CRITICAL)
2. **Integration Testing**: Blocked by API deployment

## Week 3 Status (Monday, January 7)

### Backend Team
- **Immediate Priority**: Deploy goals API routes
- **Status**: Working on critical blocker
- **Next**: Integration testing once unblocked

### Frontend Team  
- **Status**: Blocked - waiting for API deployment
- **Completed**: Goal creation wizard enhancements
- **Ready to Test**: All goal CRUD operations

### Product Manager
- **Action Taken**: Identified and documented blocker
- **Coordinating**: API deployment resolution
- **Next**: Monitor deployment, then journal contract

## Updated Week 3 Plan

### Monday (Today)
- [ ] ðŸš¨ Deploy goals API routes (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Verify API endpoints working
- [ ] Begin integration testing
- [ ] Frontend resumes goal UI testing

### Tuesday-Friday (If Unblocked Today)
- Integration testing & load testing
- Async processing implementation
- Performance optimization
- Goal templates & recommendations
- Monitoring setup

### Risk Mitigation
- If deployment takes longer, adjust sprint scope
- Consider extending sprint if needed
- Keep stakeholders informed of delays

## Sprint Metrics

### Velocity
- **Planned**: Testing & optimization
- **Actual**: Blocked by deployment issue
- **Recovery**: Can catch up if resolved today

### Quality
- **Contract Stability**: 100%
- **Implementation Quality**: Excellent
- **Integration**: Blocked

### Team Health
- **Backend**: Responding to critical issue
- **Frontend**: Blocked but patient
- **PM**: Actively coordinating resolution

---

## Key Decisions

### API Gateway Configuration
- **Decision**: Add all 8 goals routes immediately
- **Rationale**: Unblock frontend, enable testing
- **Impact**: 30-minute deployment fixes 2-day blocker

### Sprint Adjustment
- **Decision**: Maintain current sprint goals
- **Rationale**: Quick fix should minimize impact
- **Contingency**: Extend sprint if needed

## Communication

### Stakeholder Update
"Identified and resolving a deployment configuration issue. Goals functionality is complete but not yet accessible via API. Backend team is deploying the fix now. Expect normal operations to resume within hours."

### Team Update
"Critical blocker identified: Goals API routes missing from Terraform. Backend team has clear instructions to fix. Frontend team - your wizard updates look great! You'll be able to test soon."
