# Sprint 1-2 Plan - Authentication Milestone
**Duration**: 2 Weeks (Week 1 COMPLETE âœ…)
**Theme**: "Production-Ready Authentication with 2FA"
**Milestone Goal**: Complete auth system deployed to AWS with CloudFront

## Week 1 Goals (COMPLETE âœ…)
1. âœ… Complete basic authentication flow (register, login, token refresh)
2. âœ… Deploy infrastructure to AWS (Cognito, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
3. â›³ Deploy frontend to CloudFront with custom domain (ready for deployment)
4. âœ… Establish CI/CD pipeline (backend deployed)

## Week 1 Final Status
| Feature | Backend | Frontend | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| User Registration | âœ… 6h (3h actual) | âœ… 4h (3.5h actual) | COMPLETE |
| User Login | âœ… 4h (2h actual) | âœ… 4h (1.5h actual) | COMPLETE |
| Token Refresh | âœ… 3h | âœ… Integrated | COMPLETE |
| Get User Profile | âœ… Added | âœ… Ready to use | COMPLETE |
| App Shell & Routing | - | âœ… 6h (1.5h actual) | COMPLETE |
| State Management | - | âœ… 4h (2h actual) | COMPLETE |
| Core Infrastructure | âœ… 8h | - | COMPLETE |

**Week 1 Velocity**: ~150% (Both teams finished early!)

## Week 2 Goals (Starting Now)
1. Frontend-Backend Integration Testing
2. Frontend deployment to CloudFront
3. 2FA setup and verification endpoints
4. Password reset flow
5. Email verification endpoint
6. Production security hardening

## Week 2 Task Breakdown
| Feature | Backend | Frontend | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Integration Testing | Support | 4h | HIGHEST |
| CloudFront Deployment | - | 4h | HIGH |
| Email Verification | 4h | 2h | MEDIUM |
| Update Profile | 4h | 4h | MEDIUM |
| 2FA Setup/Verify | 8h | 6h | HIGH |
| Password Reset | 6h | 4h | HIGH |
| Rate Limiting | 4h | - | MEDIUM |
| Production Hardening | 6h | 2h | HIGH |

## Daily Standup Log

### Day 1 - Milestone Kickoff
**Date**: Yesterday
- Completed: 
  - âœ… Set up instruction framework for all agents
  - âœ… Designed complete authentication contract with 2FA
  - âœ… Created authentication milestone plan
  - âœ… Assigned comprehensive tasks to both agents
  - âœ… Created infrastructure blueprint

### Day 2 - Major Progress! ðŸŽ‰
**Date**: Today
- Completed:
  - âœ… Backend: Registration & Login endpoints deployed to AWS
  - âœ… Backend: Infrastructure fully operational 
  - âœ… Frontend: ALL Week 1 tasks complete (8.5 hours!)
  - âœ… Frontend: Registration, Login, Routing, State Management
  - âœ… PM: Reviewed backend work, made priority decisions
- Working on:
  - Backend: Token Refresh endpoint (highest priority)
  - Frontend: Ready for API integration testing
  - PM: Coordinating integration between teams
- Blockers: None - Both teams ahead of schedule!

### Day 3 - Week 1 Complete! ðŸŽ†
**Date**: Today (Later)
- Completed:
  - âœ… Backend: Token Refresh & Get Profile endpoints DONE
  - âœ… Backend: ALL Week 1 deliverables complete
  - âœ… Frontend: Notified of all available endpoints
  - âœ… PM: Week 1 review and Week 2 planning
- Next Actions:
  - Frontend: Begin integration testing with real APIs
  - Backend: Start Week 2 tasks (Email verification, 2FA)
  - PM: Support integration, monitor for issues
- Status: **WEEK 1 COMPLETE - 3 days early!**

### Task Assignments
- **Backend Agent**: 
  - `backend/current-task.md` - Authentication System Implementation
  - Focus: Complete Week 1 tasks (B1-B4)
- **Frontend Agent**: 
  - `frontend/current-task.md` - Authentication UI System
  - Focus: Complete Week 1 tasks (F1-F4)

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Deployment Strategy**: CloudFront + S3 for frontend, API Gateway + Lambda for backend
2. **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with TOTP-based 2FA
3. **Infrastructure**: Terraform for all resources, multi-environment support
4. **Security**: WAF on CloudFront, rate limiting on API Gateway
5. **Data Storage**: DynamoDB single-table design for user data

## Week 1 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can login and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] Frontend deployed to CloudFront
- [ ] API deployed to API Gateway
- [ ] Basic infrastructure operational
- [ ] Dev environment fully functional

## Week 2 Planning (Preview)
- 2FA implementation (TOTP with QR codes)
- Password reset via email
- Email verification flow
- Production security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

## Risk Register
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cognito complexity | High | Following AWS best practices, allocated extra time |
| CloudFront configuration | Medium | Using proven Terraform modules |
| 2FA user experience | Medium | Building intuitive UI with clear instructions |
| Integration delays | Low | Using MSW for frontend development |
