# Active Sprint Status - Week 3

## üö® CRITICAL: Contract Violation Blocking Frontend

### Date: January 8, 2025
**Sprint Goal**: Testing & Optimization Phase
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Backend contract violation

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Activity Endpoint Not Following Contract

### Problem
Backend's activity logging endpoint expects snake_case fields (`activity_type`, `activity_date`) but the OpenAPI contract specifies camelCase fields (`activityType`, `activityDate`).

### Impact
- ‚ùå Frontend cannot log activities
- ‚ùå Progress tracking blocked
- ‚ùå Activity history blocked
- ‚ùå 60% of goal features unusable

### Action Required
- **Backend**: Fix Pydantic models to accept camelCase fields (1 hour fix)
- **Frontend**: Continue waiting - your implementation is correct!

## Week 3 Progress Update

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Architecture Fixed**: Single-table design implemented
2. **API Deployed**: All endpoints live with JWT auth
3. **Frontend Tasks 1-2**: Goal editing and archiving working
4. **Infrastructure**: Everything deployed and healthy

### ‚ùå Blocked
1. **Activity Logging**: Contract violation in field naming
2. **Progress Visualization**: Depends on activities
3. **Activity History**: Depends on activities

### üîÑ In Progress
- Backend fixing contract violation (ETA: 1 hour)
- Frontend ready to resume testing

---

## Team Status

### Backend Team
- **Immediate Priority**: Fix camelCase/snake_case issue
- **Status**: Critical fix in progress
- **ETA**: 1 hour to deploy

### Frontend Team  
- **Status**: Blocked on Task 3 (activities)
- **Completed**: Tasks 1-2 (edit, archive)
- **Ready**: To test once backend fixes contract

### Product Manager
- **Action**: Identified and escalated blocker
- **Focus**: Ensuring contract compliance
- **Next**: Monitor fix deployment

## Contract Compliance Reminder

### The Law of the Contract üìú
```yaml
# OpenAPI Contract says:
activityType: string    # camelCase ‚úÖ
activityDate: string    # camelCase ‚úÖ

# NOT:
activity_type: string   # snake_case ‚ùå
activity_date: string   # snake_case ‚ùå
```

### Why This Matters
1. **Type Safety**: Frontend generates types from contract
2. **Integration**: Contract is our integration agreement
3. **Trust**: Teams rely on contract accuracy
4. **Future**: Other consumers will use same contract

## Sprint Metrics Update

### Velocity
- **Goal Features**: 40% complete (edit/archive working)
- **Blocked Features**: 60% (activities/progress)
- **Recovery**: Quick fix will unblock everything

### Quality
- **Contract Violations**: 1 critical found
- **Fix Complexity**: Low (field naming)
- **Future Prevention**: Review all models

### Communication
- **Issue Escalation**: Immediate ‚úÖ
- **Team Alignment**: Both teams aware ‚úÖ
- **Solution Clarity**: Clear fix path ‚úÖ

---

## Adjusted Timeline

### Today (Tuesday)
- **Next Hour**: Backend fixes contract violation
- **Afternoon**: Frontend resumes testing
- **Evening**: All goal features working

### Rest of Week
- Complete integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Async processing
- Load testing Friday

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Contract First**: Both teams must follow contract exactly
2. **Field Naming**: Consistency crucial for integration
3. **Quick Detection**: Frontend caught issue immediately
4. **Clear Communication**: Fast escalation enables quick fix
