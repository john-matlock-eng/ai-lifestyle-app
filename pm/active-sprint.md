# Sprint 1-2 Plan - Authentication Milestone
**Duration**: 2 Weeks (Week 1 in progress)
**Theme**: "Production-Ready Authentication with 2FA"
**Milestone Goal**: Complete auth system deployed to AWS with CloudFront

## Week 1 Goals (Current)
1. Complete basic authentication flow (register, login, token refresh)
2. Deploy infrastructure to AWS (Cognito, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
3. Deploy frontend to CloudFront with custom domain
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline

## Week 2 Goals (Upcoming)
1. Implement 2FA setup and verification
2. Add password reset flow
3. Production security hardening
4. Complete documentation and testing

## Committed Work - Week 1
| Feature | Backend | Frontend | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| User Registration | 6h (B1) | 4h (F1) | In Progress |
| User Login | 4h (B2) | 4h (F2) | Ready |
| Token Refresh | 3h (B3) | - | Ready |
| App Shell & Routing | - | 6h (F3) | Ready |
| State Management | - | 4h (F4) | Ready |
| Core Infrastructure | 8h (B4) | - | Ready |
| Frontend Deploy | 4h (D1) | - | Ready |

## Infrastructure Components
- [x] OpenAPI Contract with 2FA endpoints
- [ ] Cognito User Pool with MFA
- [ ] DynamoDB users table
- [ ] API Gateway with JWT authorizer
- [ ] CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Route 53 domain setup
- [ ] ACM SSL certificates
- [ ] Lambda container deployments

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Authentication working end-to-end
- [ ] Frontend accessible via https://ailifestyleapp.com
- [ ] API accessible via https://api.ailifestyleapp.com
- [ ] <200ms API response time (p95)
- [ ] 2FA setup and verification functional
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities

## Daily Standup Log

### Day 1 - Milestone Kickoff
**Date**: Today
- Completed: 
  - ✅ Set up instruction framework for all agents
  - ✅ Designed complete authentication contract with 2FA
  - ✅ Created authentication milestone plan
  - ✅ Assigned comprehensive tasks to both agents
  - ✅ Created infrastructure blueprint
- Working on:
  - Backend Agent: User registration endpoint + infrastructure
  - Frontend Agent: Registration UI + project setup
  - PM: Monitoring progress, preparing deployment pipeline
- Blockers: None

### Task Assignments
- **Backend Agent**: 
  - `backend/current-task.md` - Authentication System Implementation
  - Focus: Complete Week 1 tasks (B1-B4)
- **Frontend Agent**: 
  - `frontend/current-task.md` - Authentication UI System
  - Focus: Complete Week 1 tasks (F1-F4)

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Deployment Strategy**: CloudFront + S3 for frontend, API Gateway + Lambda for backend
2. **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with TOTP-based 2FA
3. **Infrastructure**: Terraform for all resources, multi-environment support
4. **Security**: WAF on CloudFront, rate limiting on API Gateway
5. **Data Storage**: DynamoDB single-table design for user data

## Week 1 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can login and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] Frontend deployed to CloudFront
- [ ] API deployed to API Gateway
- [ ] Basic infrastructure operational
- [ ] Dev environment fully functional

## Week 2 Planning (Preview)
- 2FA implementation (TOTP with QR codes)
- Password reset via email
- Email verification flow
- Production security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

## Risk Register
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cognito complexity | High | Following AWS best practices, allocated extra time |
| CloudFront configuration | Medium | Using proven Terraform modules |
| 2FA user experience | Medium | Building intuitive UI with clear instructions |
| Integration delays | Low | Using MSW for frontend development |
