# Active Sprint Status - Week 3

## üö® TWO CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Date: January 7, 2025
**Sprint Goal**: Testing & Optimization Phase
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Architecture + Deployment Issues

## Issue #1: Single Table Design Violation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Problem
The goals implementation creates separate DynamoDB tables, violating our single-table design principle.

### Solution
- Use the existing `users` table for ALL entities
- Update repository code to use proper PK/SK patterns
- Remove separate goals tables from Terraform
- **ADR Created**: ADR-005-single-table-dynamodb.md

### Status
- Backend team has clear implementation guide
- Estimated fix time: 2-4 hours

---

## Issue #2: Lambda Not Deployed (SECOND PRIORITY)

### Problem
The Lambda function isn't deployed because `deploy_lambda = false` in Terraform by default.

### Investigation Results
- ‚úÖ API Gateway routes ARE configured correctly
- ‚úÖ Main.py DOES route to goals handlers
- ‚ùå Lambda deployment is disabled by default

### Solution
After fixing the single-table architecture:
```bash
cd backend/terraform
terraform apply -var="deploy_lambda=true"
```

### Note
The goals routes ARE in the API Gateway configuration, and the Lambda handler DOES route to goals endpoints. The 404 errors are because the Lambda itself isn't deployed.

## Corrected Action Plan

### Step 1: Fix Architecture (2-4 hours)
1. Update goals repository to use single table
2. Remove separate tables from Terraform  
3. Update environment variables
4. Test locally

### Step 2: Deploy Everything (30 minutes)
1. Deploy with Lambda enabled:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var="deploy_lambda=true"
   ```
2. Verify all endpoints work
3. Frontend can begin testing

---

## Good News

- API Gateway configuration is correct ‚úÖ
- Lambda routing is correct ‚úÖ
- Only need to fix table design and deploy
- No missing routes to add

## Updated Timeline

### Today (Monday)
- **Morning**: Fix single-table architecture
- **Afternoon**: Deploy with Lambda enabled
- **Evening**: Frontend testing begins

### Rest of Week
- Back on track with original plan
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Async processing

## Key Learnings

1. **Architecture First**: Single-table design is critical
2. **Deployment Flags**: Check deployment settings
3. **Investigation Wins**: Found the real issues
4. **Team Excellence**: Backend caught architecture issue early

**Sprint Health**: üü° Blocked but fixable today
**Architecture Issue**: üî¥ Critical - in progress
**Deployment Issue**: üü° Simple fix after architecture
**Team Morale**: üíö High - solving real problems
