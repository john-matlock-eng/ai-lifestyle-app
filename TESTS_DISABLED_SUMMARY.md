# Tests Disabled in CI/CD Pipeline

## Summary
I've successfully disabled tests in your CI/CD pipeline to allow deployments to proceed without test failures blocking them.

## What was done:

### 1. Frontend CI/CD (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`)
- Commented out the entire `test` job that was running:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run type-check`
  - `npm run test:ci`
  - Build verification
- Removed the `needs: test` dependency from both development and production deployment jobs
- Added comments to clearly indicate tests are temporarily disabled

### 2. Backend CI/CD
- No changes were needed - the backend workflows don't run tests

### 3. Documentation
- Created `CI_CD_TESTS_DISABLED.md` with full details on what was changed and how to re-enable
- Updated `frontend/CLAUDE.md` to warn that tests are disabled

## Impact:
- ✅ Pull requests will deploy to development without running tests
- ✅ Pushes to main will deploy to production without running tests
- ⚠️ No automated quality checks before deployment

## To re-enable tests later:
1. Fix the failing tests locally
2. Uncomment the `test` job in `frontend-ci-cd.yml`
3. Add back `needs: test` to the deployment jobs
4. Remove the "TESTS DISABLED" comments

## Next deployment will:
- Skip all tests
- Go directly to building and deploying
- Still require successful build to deploy

This is a temporary measure - tests should be re-enabled once the issues are resolved to maintain code quality.
