# Goal System Pivot - Complete Summary

## What We Discovered

Your excellent question about real-world goals (10,000 steps, write 10,000 words, etc.) revealed that our initial goal model only supported ~40% of common lifestyle goals. This would have been a major limitation!

## What We've Done

### 1. Analyzed the Problem
- Tested 10+ real-world goal examples
- Identified 5 distinct goal patterns needed
- Found gaps in AI data collection

### 2. Designed Enhanced Solution
- **[Enhanced Goal Model v2](./docs/features/core/goal-system-design-v2.md)** - Supports ALL patterns
- **[Model Analysis](./docs/features/core/goal-model-analysis.md)** - Real-world validation
- **[Quick Summary](./docs/features/core/GOAL-MODEL-SUMMARY.md)** - Executive overview

### 3. Created Architecture Decisions
- **[ADR-003](./docs/adr/ADR-003-generic-goal-system.md)** - Generic system decision
- **[ADR-004](./docs/adr/ADR-004-enhanced-goal-model.md)** - Enhanced model decision

### 4. Updated Sprint Plans
- **[Goal System Sprint Plan](./docs/features/core/goal-system-sprint-plan.md)** - 4-week implementation
- **[Active Sprint Status](./pm/active-sprint.md)** - Updated timeline
- **[Backend Tasks](./backend/current-task.md)** - Goal system assignments
- **[Frontend Tasks](./frontend/current-task.md)** - UI component plans

### 5. Revised Journaling Integration
- **[Goal System Integration](./docs/features/journaling/goal-system-integration.md)** - How journaling uses generic goals

## Next Steps

### This Week (Week 2)
1. Complete authentication (2FA, CloudFront)
2. Review goal system design
3. Prepare for implementation

### Next Week (Week 3)
1. Start goal system build
2. Database and models first
3. Pattern components in parallel

### Following Weeks
