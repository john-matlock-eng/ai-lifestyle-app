# AI Lifestyle App - Feature Status & Next Steps

## 🎉 Congratulations! Your App is Deployed!

### ✅ What's Working Now

#### 1. **Authentication System**
- User registration with email verification
- Login/logout with JWT tokens
- Password reset flow
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Protected routes
- Session management with warnings

#### 2. **Goal Management** (Core Features)
- **Create Goals** with 5 different patterns:
  - 📅 **Recurring**: Daily/weekly habits (e.g., "Exercise 3x per week")
  - 🎯 **Target**: Reach a number (e.g., "Read 12 books this year")
  - 🔥 **Streak**: Consecutive days (e.g., "Meditate for 30 days straight")
  - 🏆 **Milestone**: One-time achievements (e.g., "Run a marathon")
  - 🛡️ **Limit**: Stay under threshold (e.g., "Less than 2 hours social media daily")
- **Goal List View** with filters and sorting
- **Quick Activity Logging**
- **Basic Progress Visualization**

#### 3. **Infrastructure**
- Frontend on CloudFront CDN
- Backend API on AWS Lambda
- Database on DynamoDB
- Auth with Cognito
- CI/CD pipelines working

### 🚧 What Needs Completion

#### 1. **Enhanced Goal Features**
- [ ] Detailed goal pages with full activity history
- [ ] Advanced progress charts (the components exist but need integration)
- [ ] Goal templates for quick setup
- [ ] Data export/import
- [ ] Goal sharing between users

#### 2. **AI Features** (Not Started)
- [ ] AI-powered insights and recommendations
- [ ] Pattern recognition in user behavior
- [ ] Personalized goal suggestions
- [ ] Predictive analytics for goal success

#### 3. **Social Features**
- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Follow other users
- [ ] Share achievements
- [ ] Challenges and competitions
- [ ] Community feed

#### 4. **Mobile Experience**
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Mobile-optimized UI (current is responsive but basic)

### 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. **Complete Goal Details Page**
The GoalDetail component exists but needs to be wired up:

```typescript
// In GoalsPage.tsx, add navigation to detail view
const handleViewGoal = (goal: Goal) => {
  navigate(`/goals/${goal.goalId}`);
};

// Add route in App.tsx
<Route path="/goals/:goalId" element={<GoalDetailPage />} />
```

#### 2. **Integrate Progress Charts**
The ProgressCharts component is built but not integrated:

```typescript
// In goal detail page
import { ProgressCharts } from '@features/goals/components/GoalProgress/ProgressCharts';

<ProgressCharts 
  goal={goal} 
  activities={activities} 
  progress={goal.progress} 
/>
```

#### 3. **Add Real Data to Dashboard**
Currently showing mock data. Update to use real user stats:

```typescript
// In DashboardPage.tsx
const { data: goals } = useGoals();
const activeGoals = goals?.filter(g => g.status === 'active').length || 0;
```

### 💻 Development Workflow

#### Local Development
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Your local changes will hot-reload
# Login with your deployed credentials
```

#### Deployment
```bash
# Changes pushed to main branch auto-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add goal details page"
git push origin main

# Or create a PR for dev environment
git checkout -b feature/goal-details
git push origin feature/goal-details
# Create PR → Deploys to dev environment
```
