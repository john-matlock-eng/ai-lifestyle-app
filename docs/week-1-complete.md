### Next Step: Integration Testing
The teams are now ready to connect:
1. Frontend updates API base URL
2. Remove MSW mocks for real endpoints
3. Test full authentication flow
4. Report any integration issues

## 📅 Week 2 Preview

### Priority Order
1. **Integration Testing** (HIGHEST)
2. **CloudFront Deployment**
3. **2FA Implementation**
4. **Password Reset Flow**
5. **Email Verification**
6. **Production Hardening**

### Expected Outcomes
- Full auth system in production
- 2FA working end-to-end
- Password reset self-service
- Frontend on CloudFront
- Production-grade security

## 🎯 Success Factors

### What Worked Well
