# Post-Mortem: Authentication Lambda Failure

## Incident Summary
- **Date**: 2025-01-05
- **Time**: 16:22 - [TBD] UTC
- **Impact**: Complete authentication outage - no users could login or register
- **Root Cause**: Import error in Lambda function due to missing export in shared module

## Timeline
- **16:22 UTC**: First Lambda errors detected in CloudWatch
- **16:23 UTC**: Multiple retries, all failing with same error
- **16:25 UTC**: Issue identified and hotfix task created
- **16:45 UTC**: Fix implemented - added missing exports to goals_common
- **[TBD]**: PR created and reviewed
- **[TBD]**: Fix deployed via Terraform
- **[TBD]**: Service restored

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened
The Lambda function failed to initialize with error:
```
Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'main': 
cannot import name 'GoalValidationError' from 'goals_common'
```

### Why It Happened
1. Backend team created shared `goals_common` module for goal system
2. The module was imported into the auth handler (likely for shared error handling)
3. `GoalValidationError` was not properly exported in `goals_common/__init__.py`
4. This wasn't caught in testing because:
   - Local tests may have had different import paths
   - Integration tests weren't run before deployment

## Impact
- ❌ 100% authentication failure rate
- ❌ Users unable to access the application
- ❌ New user registrations blocked
- ❌ Estimated [X] users affected

## Resolution

### Fix Applied
Added missing error class exports to `backend/src/goals_common/__init__.py`:
```python
from .errors import (
    GoalError,
    GoalNotFoundError,
    GoalValidationError,  # This was missing!
    # ... other error classes
)
```

### Verification
- Created test script to verify all imports work
- Tested locally - all imports successful
- Ready for deployment via Terraform

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Quick detection through CloudWatch monitoring
- Rapid identification of root cause
- Clear error messages in Lambda logs

### What Went Wrong
- Shared module changes affected unrelated services
- No pre-deployment integration tests
- No canary deployment to catch errors early

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Add integration tests that import all Lambda handlers
- [ ] Create pre-deployment checklist
- [ ] Document shared module dependencies

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Implement canary deployments
- [ ] Add automated import verification
- [ ] Create dependency graph for Lambda functions
- [ ] Add health checks that test actual handler imports

### Long-term
- [ ] Consider module isolation strategies
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments
- [ ] Add synthetic monitoring for critical paths

## Prevention Measures

### Pre-deployment Checklist
1. Run all unit tests
2. Run integration tests
3. Test Lambda handler imports locally
4. Deploy to staging first
5. Run smoke tests on staging
6. Use canary deployment for production

### Code Review Focus
- Any changes to shared modules require extra scrutiny
- Check all __init__.py exports
- Verify import statements in dependent modules

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
def test_lambda_imports():
    """Verify all Lambda handlers can be imported"""
    handlers = [
        'backend.handlers.auth.main',
        'backend.handlers.goals.create_goal.main',
        # ... all handlers
    ]
    
    for handler in handlers:
        try:
            importlib.import_module(handler)
        except ImportError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Failed to import {handler}: {e}")
```
