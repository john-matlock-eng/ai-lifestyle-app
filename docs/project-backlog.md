## Current Sprint Status

### Authentication Milestone (Sprint 1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Week 1**: ‚úÖ All core endpoints complete and deployed
- **Week 2**: 2FA implementation in progress

### Journaling Feature (Sprint 2-4) üéØ STARTING
- **Sprint 2.1** (Week 1-2): Core journaling functionality
- **Sprint 2.2** (Week 3-4): AI integration and goals
- **Sprint 2.3** (Week 5-6): Social features and polish

## Technical Debt & Infrastructure
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize DynamoDB queries with GSIs
   - Add CloudFront for static assets ‚è≥ (Frontend ready for deployment)

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Set up comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Add business metrics tracking

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement rate limiting ‚è≥ (Week 2 task)
   - Add API key management for third-party integrations
   - Security audit and penetration testing

## DICE Scoring Explanation
- **D**ata Safety (0-5): How critical is user data protection?
- **I**mpact (0-5): How many users will benefit?
- **C**omplexity (0-5): How difficult to implement? (lower is more complex)
- **E**ffort (0-5): How many hours needed? (lower is more effort)

Formula: `Priority = (Data Safety √ó 2 + Impact √ó 2) / (Complexity + Effort)`

### DICE Calculations
- **Journaling**: (5√ó2 + 4√ó2) / (3 + 2) = 18/5 = 4.2 (High privacy needs, high impact)
- **Nutrition**: (4√ó2 + 4√ó2) / (3 + 3) = 16/4.2 = 3.8
- **Barcode**: (3√ó2 + 4√ó2) / (4 + 4) = 14/4 = 3.5

## Sprint Planning Notes
- ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Authentication foundation COMPLETE
- üéØ Sprint 2-4: Journaling feature (user requested, high wellness impact)
- Sprint 5: Nutrition tracking to complement wellness journey
- Sprint 6+: Additional features based on user feedback
