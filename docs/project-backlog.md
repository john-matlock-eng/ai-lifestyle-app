## Technical Debt & Infrastructure
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize DynamoDB queries with GSIs
   - Add CloudFront for static assets

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Set up comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Add business metrics tracking

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API key management for third-party integrations
   - Security audit and penetration testing

## DICE Scoring Explanation
- **D**ata Safety (0-5): How critical is user data protection?
- **I**mpact (0-5): How many users will benefit?
- **C**omplexity (0-5): How difficult to implement? (lower is more complex)
- **E**ffort (0-5): How many hours needed? (lower is more effort)

Formula: `Priority = (Data Safety Ã— 2 + Impact Ã— 2) / (Complexity + Effort)`

## Sprint Planning Notes
- Sprint 1: Focus on authentication as the foundation
- Sprint 2: Core nutrition features to deliver immediate value
- Sprint 3+: Build on the foundation with AI and social features
- Technical debt addressed incrementally each sprint
