## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Technical Choices
- **Editor**: TipTap v2 (extensible, markdown support)
- **AI**: AWS Bedrock with Claude API
- **State**: Zustand (lightweight, TypeScript-friendly)
- **Storage**: DynamoDB single-table design
- **Privacy**: Client-side encryption option

### Product Decisions
- **Privacy First**: All entries private by default
- **AI Optional**: Users control when AI analyzes
- **Goal Flexibility**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom
- **Social Features**: Phase 3 (can be deferred if needed)

## üìä Resource Summary

### Development Effort
- **Total Hours**: 194 hours (~5 weeks)
- **Backend**: 82 hours
- **Frontend**: 90 hours  
- **Testing**: 22 hours

### Team Needs
- 1 Backend Engineer (lead on AI integration)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (lead on TipTap)
- Shared: QA, DevOps support

### Monthly Costs (10K users)
- Infrastructure: $500
- AI API: $300
- Storage: $200
- **Total**: ~$1,000/month ($0.10/user)

## üöÄ Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Update OpenAPI Contract**
   - Merge journaling endpoints into main contract
   - Generate TypeScript types
   - Validate with teams

2. **Assign Sprint 1 Tasks**
   - Backend: J-B1, J-B2, J-B3
   - Frontend: J-F1, J-F2, J-F3

3. **Set Up Infrastructure**
   - Create new DynamoDB table
   - Configure S3 bucket for media
   - Set up AI service credentials

### Week 1 Deliverables
- Working editor in frontend
- Basic CRUD API deployed
- Privacy controls implemented
- Media upload functional

### Success Criteria (Sprint 1)
- [ ] User can create a journal entry
- [ ] Entry saves and retrieves correctly
- [ ] Private entries are secure
- [ ] Editor works on mobile
- [ ] Images can be uploaded

## üìà Risk Watch

### High Priority
1. **TipTap Complexity**: May need 2-3 extra days
2. **AI Rate Limits**: Need caching strategy early

### Medium Priority  
1. **Mobile Performance**: Test early and often
2. **Content Moderation**: Define policy before social features

### Mitigation Ready
- Social features can move to v2 if needed
- AI can fall back to template prompts
- Export feature can be simplified

## üí° Innovation Opportunities

### During Development
- Voice-to-text for mobile journaling
- Mood detection from writing style
- Daily email summaries of entries

### Post-Launch
- Therapist collaboration tools
- Group journaling for teams
- Integration with meditation apps

## üìû Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- 10am ET: Backend/Frontend sync
- Focus on integration points
- Identify blockers early

### Weekly Reviews
- Friday 3pm: Feature demo
- Stakeholder feedback
- Sprint planning adjustments

### Escalation Path
1. Technical blockers ‚Üí Senior Engineer
2. Product questions ‚Üí PM
3. Resource needs ‚Üí Engineering Manager
