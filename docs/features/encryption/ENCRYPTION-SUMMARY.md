## 🔐 System Overview

### How It Works
1. **Zero-Knowledge**: We never see unencrypted content or keys
2. **User-Controlled**: Password derives all encryption keys
3. **Selective Sharing**: Users can share with specific friends
4. **Multiple Recovery**: Balance between security and usability

### Key Technologies
- **Master Key**: PBKDF2 (100k iterations) from password
- **Personal Keys**: RSA-4096 for key exchange
- **Content Encryption**: AES-256-GCM per entry
- **Recovery**: 24-word mnemonic (BIP39)

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

- ✅ Public key directory
- ✅ Re-encryption for recipients
- ✅ Permission management

### Phase 3: Recovery Options (1 week)
- ✅ Mnemonic phrase generation
- ✅ Social recovery (3 of 5 friends)
- ✅ Recovery flows

### Phase 4: UI/UX (1 week)
- ✅ Encryption toggles
- ✅ Sharing interface
- ✅ Recovery setup wizard

### Phase 5: Launch (1 week)
- ✅ Migration tools
- ✅ Feature flags
- ✅ Documentation

## 💡 Key Features

### For Users
- **Toggle Encryption**: Per-entry control
- **Share Securely**: Friends can decrypt shared entries
- **Recovery Options**: Never lose access to your data
- **Premium Feature**: Part of premium subscription

### For Developers
- **Web Crypto API**: Native browser encryption
- **Web Workers**: Non-blocking operations
- **IndexedDB**: Secure local key storage
- **React Hooks**: Simple integration

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Benefits
- **True Privacy**: Not even we can read encrypted content
- **Legal Protection**: Cannot provide what we don't have
- **Premium Value**: Strong monetization opportunity
- **Trust Building**: Privacy-first reputation

### Trade-offs
- **No Server Search**: Search happens client-side only
- **No AI Analysis**: Unless user explicitly allows
- **Recovery Complexity**: Users must manage recovery options
- **Support Limitations**: Cannot help if password forgotten

## 🔧 Technical Stack

```typescript
// Core dependencies
{
  "@noble/ed25519": "^2.0.0",      // Elliptic curve crypto
  "@noble/hashes": "^1.3.3",        // Hashing functions
  "idb": "^8.0.0",                  // IndexedDB wrapper

}
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 10% of users enable within 6 months
- **Performance**: <100ms encryption overhead
- **Premium Conversion**: 25% higher for encryption users
- **Churn Reduction**: 15% lower for encryption users

## 🔍 Security Model

### Protects Against
- ✅ Server compromise
- ✅ Legal data requests
- ✅ Insider threats
- ✅ Data breaches

### Does NOT Protect Against
- ❌ Compromised user device
- ❌ Weak passwords
- ❌ Phishing attacks
- ❌ User sharing passwords

## 🚦 Quick Decision Guide

### When to Use Encryption
- Sensitive journal entries
- Medical information
- Financial data
- Personal struggles
- Any ultra-private content

### When NOT to Use
- Content you want to search server-side
- Entries you want AI to analyze
- Public or shared journals
- When recovery options aren't set up
