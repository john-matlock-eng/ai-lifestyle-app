## 🧠 AI Analysis Improvements

### Before: Basic Data
```typescript
{
  goalId: "123",
  completed: true,
  date: "2024-01-15"
}
```

### After: Rich Context
```typescript
{
  goalId: "123",
  value: 10500,
  context: {
    timeOfDay: "morning",
    weather: { condition: "sunny", temp: 72 },
    energyLevel: 8,
    sleepHours: 7.5,
    location: "park",
    withOthers: true,
    mood: "energetic",
    previousActivity: "coffee",
    enjoyment: 9
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Real Examples That Now Work

### 1. "Finish my novel" (Milestone)
- Track total words written (not daily)
- Show progress bar to 80,000 words
- AI predicts completion date

### 2. "Get to 180 lbs by summer" (Target)
- Track weight trend (can go up/down)
- Show trajectory toward goal
- AI suggests adjustments

### 3. "100-day gym streak" (Streak)
- Primary metric is the streak itself
- Show calendar visualization
- AI identifies risk days

### 4. "Max 2 hours social media" (Limit)
- Track against maximum (not minimum)
- Show days over limit
- AI suggests reduction strategies

### 5. "Read 52 books this year" (Annual)
- Track cumulative for the year
- Show books behind/ahead of pace
- AI recommends based on reading speed

## 📊 What This Enables

### Cross-Goal Intelligence
- "You read more when you limit screen time"
- "Your steps increase after good sleep"
- "Journaling improves your workout consistency"

### Predictive Insights
- "Based on patterns, you'll likely complete your novel by March"
- "Skip risk high on Mondays - try scheduling differently"
- "Your current pace will have you 10 books short - read 15 min more daily"

### Personalized Recommendations
- "You perform best at 7am based on 89% success rate"
- "Rainy days reduce your steps by 40% - try indoor alternatives"
- "Working out with friends increases your completion by 60%"

## 🚀 Implementation Impact

### Development Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core + recurring goals
- **Week 2**: All goal patterns  
- **Week 3**: AI context layer
- **Week 4**: Feature integration

### API Simplicity
```yaml
# Same endpoints for ALL goal types
POST   /goals              # Create any goal type
GET    /goals              # List all goals
POST   /goals/{id}/track   # Track any activity
GET    /goals/insights     # AI analysis across all
```

### UI Components
