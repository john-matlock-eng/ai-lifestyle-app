# AI Analysis Feature - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Feature Overview

We're extending our encryption system to enable AI analysis of encrypted journal entries. Users can selectively share specific entries with our AI service for insights while maintaining complete privacy control.

## 🎯 The Big Picture

**What**: Selective AI analysis of encrypted entries
**Why**: Enable powerful insights without compromising privacy
**How**: Temporary re-encryption for AI service with user control
**When**: 6-week implementation starting now

## 📋 Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: AI service acts as a "trusted friend" in encryption system
2. **User Control**: Explicit selection of entries for analysis
3. **Privacy**: Time-limited access with immediate deletion after processing
4. **Security**: Secure enclave processing with full audit trail
