# ADR-002: Journaling as First Major Feature

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Decision Makers**: Product Manager, Development Team, Stakeholder

## Context

After successfully completing the authentication foundation, we need to choose our first major feature. The original backlog prioritized nutrition tracking, but we've received a specific request to implement journaling functionality. This feature would include:

- Rich text editing with TipTap and markdown support
- AI-powered prompts and insights
- Goal-based journaling with reminders
- Privacy controls with optional sharing
- Analytics and mood tracking

## Decision

We will implement **AI-Powered Journaling** as our first major feature after authentication.

## Rationale

### 1. Mental Health is Foundational to Wellness
- Mental wellness directly impacts all other health behaviors
- Journaling is proven to reduce stress and improve mental clarity
- Creates a strong foundation for users to build other healthy habits

### 2. High User Engagement Potential
- Daily use case (vs. sporadic meal logging)
- Builds habit formation early in the user journey
- Personal and emotional connection increases retention

### 3. AI Differentiation
- Showcases our AI capabilities immediately
- Creates unique value proposition vs. simple journal apps
- AI insights provide immediate value to users

### 4. Lower External Dependencies
- No need for food databases or nutrition APIs
- No barcode scanning libraries required
- Can deliver full value with internal capabilities

### 5. Technical Benefits
- Tests our AI infrastructure early
- Validates our privacy and encryption approach
- Creates reusable components (editor, sharing, goals)

### 6. Business Model Clarity
- Clear premium features (AI analysis, unlimited storage)
- B2B potential for corporate wellness programs
- Data insights valuable for research (with consent)

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Nutrition Tracking First
- **Pros**: Immediate practical value, clear monetization
- **Cons**: Crowded market, heavy API dependencies, complex data entry

### Option 2: Fitness Tracking First
- **Pros**: Popular use case, wearable integration opportunity
- **Cons**: Requires hardware integration, competitive market

### Option 3: Habit Tracking First
- **Pros**: Simple to build, broad appeal
- **Cons**: Many free alternatives, limited AI differentiation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Establishes app as holistic wellness platform, not just another fitness tracker
- Creates strong emotional connection with users
- Provides rich data for AI model training (with consent)
- Differentiates us in the market immediately

### Negative
- Longer development time (6 weeks vs. 3 for nutrition)
- More complex privacy requirements
- Moderation needs for shared content
- May not appeal to users seeking purely physical health features

### Neutral
- Shifts our initial market positioning toward mental wellness
- Requires content moderation strategy earlier than planned
- Increases importance of mobile experience (journaling on-the-go)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Journaling (Weeks 1-2)
- Basic CRUD operations
- TipTap editor integration
- Privacy controls

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- Prompt generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Theme extraction

### Phase 3: Social & Polish (Weeks 5-6)
- Sharing features
- Analytics dashboard
- Mobile optimization

## Success Metrics
- 60% of users create at least one journal entry
- 30% of users journal at least weekly
- Average session time >5 minutes
- AI feature usage >40%
- User satisfaction score >4.2/5

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend
- **TipTap** for rich text editing (extensible, well-maintained)
- **Zustand** for state management (lightweight, TypeScript-friendly)

### Backend  
- **AWS Bedrock** for AI (Claude API for quality responses)
- **DynamoDB** single-table design (scalable, cost-effective)
- **ElastiCache** for performance (frequently accessed entries)

### Security
- Client-side encryption option for sensitive entries
- Row-level security in DynamoDB
- Temporary sharing links with expiration

## Review Date
3 months after launch - assess user adoption and decide on next feature priority
